              <h2>Displacement – a way of life in Maguindanao</h2>
              <h3>31,500 people remain displaced  by clashes in Maguindanao</h3>
                <p>Continuous clashes between  Government forces and armed groups since 5 February displaced over 41,800  people in six municipalities of Maguindanao province. While some have returned  to their homes, about 31,500 people remain displaced as of 28 March, according  to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in the Autonomous  Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The majority of the internally displaced  people (IDPs) – about 28,100 – are staying at 13 evacuation centres, while the  remaining 3,400 people are &ldquo;home-based&rdquo; IDPs hosted by the neighboring  communities</p>
                Many of the displaced  families and their hosts are the same people affected by the Government&rsquo;s  military operations against the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) – a break way of the Moro  Islamic Liberation Front seeking independence for Bangsamoro – in early 2015, which displaced over 148,000 people in  Maguindanao province.

              <h3>Host communities burdened  by frequent and long-term displacement</h3>
              <p>Recurrent  displacement has become a way of life for most communities in Maguindanao and  the adjacent provinces of central Mindanao.                 
A large number of people  displaced by recent conflict (some dating back to over a year) involving the military,  the BIFF and other Moro groups have moved to urban centres to seek protection  and support from their relatives and friends and larger host communities.  Besides disrupting family life and livelihoods of the IDPs themselves, frequent  and often long-term displacement has eroded the coping capacity of their  already-poor host communities. They continue to share often-inadequate food and  water as well as crowded shelter, sanitation and education facilities.  Meanwhile, insecurity is constraining farmers from cultivating land, straining  food security of the displaced and host households alike.

<p>Erosion  of the coping capacity of these displaced people and the impact this has on their  hosts pose a challenge to local authorities and aid agencies trying to address  the humanitarian situation in central Mindanao. Government assistance to  displaced people has been limited to small food rations (e.g. two to three kilograms  of rice and three tins of sardines per family to consume for several weeks), with  an aim to prevent the relief goods from being accessed by armed groups. However,  frequent violence has hampered regular access of the Government and aid  agencies to the affected communities, making it difficult for the IDPs to meet  their daily food needs without support from their host communities. Ironically,  these host communities who are often the first responders to displacement are largely  left out from organised humanitarian assistance, and this has created tensions  and sometimes conflict between them and the IDPs.</p>

              </div></p>
<h3>Long term assistance to  vulnerable communities key to lasting peace in Maguindanao</h3>
                <p>IDPs from areas where the  BIFF is operational, mainly in the municipalities of Datu Salibo and Datu Piang  close to Ligwasan Marsh, are suspected of supporting the BIFF.  Restrictions on humanitarian access and  limited relief efforts to these IDPs and their host communities may further  alienate and frustrate them. This is feared to radicalise the communities and  especially the youth amid political uncertainties following the recent setback  in the peace process due to the delayed passage of the draft Bangsamoro Basic  Law. Meanwhile, the BIFF may be gaining support from these communities as they  become more vulnerable with fewer options. To prevent escalation of inter-group  tensions and further suffering of the communities caught in the middle of  recurrent fighting, there is an urgent need to strategically reach out to them  with sustained humanitarian and development assistance.</p><div> <div>

              <h2>Emergency health assistance following Typhoon Koppu</h2>
              <h3><strong>Typhoon Koppu and Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)</strong></h3>
                <p>&ldquo;We  evacuated before the typhoon to a local evacuation centre, but when I went back  to my field after the storm it was all flooded and crops were damaged&rdquo; said  Sari Evangelista, a 46-year-old mother of five children at the crowded barangay  (the smallest administrative unit in the Philippines) health station in Santa  Juliana, Capas municipality of Tarlac province. On 16 March, she walked for  four hours with her 11-month-old baby and 2-year-old son to the health station  to receive their malnutrition screening and treatment.</p>
              <p><div class="img-holder">

              </div></p>
<p>Large areas of central  Luzon including Tarlac were inundated for weeks due to heavy rains from  Category-3 Typhoon Koppu (known locally as Lando), which traversed central and  northern Luzon in October 2015. It was the most destructive typhoon of the  year, which displaced over 1 million people at the height of the disaster,  damaged some 137,700 houses and caused over US$200 million damage to  agriculture. </p>
<p>In the wake of the typhoon,  international aid agencies supported the Government with conduct of  multi-sectoral rapid damage assessment and needs analysis and targeted  provision of food, emergency shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH),  health, camp management and camp coordination, agriculture, logistics,  information management and overall coordination assistance. </p>
To mitigate deteriorating  food insecurity and address rising risks of malnutrition and diseases among the  affected communities, the UN<a href="mailto:http://www.unocha.org/cerf/" target="new"> Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)</a> allocated $1.5 million in November 2015 to  support agricultural and health assistance in Nueva Ecija, Pampanga and Tarlac  provinces in Region III and Pangasinan province in Region I. The CERF-funded  projects of FAO and WHO are helping some 212,000 people affected by Typhoon  Koppu, including 65,000 people from small-scale, rice-farming households whose  crops were devastated in Region III. The projects include provision of  certified rice seeds and fertilizers and essential health care and disease  surveillance for a five-month period until April 2016.

</div>
                <h3><strong>Emergency health project targets the most vulnerable among the  typhoon-affected people</strong></h3>
                <p>WHO  as the co-lead of the country&rsquo;s Health Cluster, in partnership with the health  authorities at the national and local levels, ACF and IMC, has set up primary  medical and surgical services and barangay-level disease surveillance and early  warning systems across 18 selected municipalities in the four affected  provinces. The project also screens and treats acute malnutrition cases of  children under age five in selected municipalities in Tarlac and Nueva Ecija  provinces. Identification of barangays and municipalities targeted by the  project took into account direct impact of Typhoon Koppu (density of damage to  houses and farms) as well as health system vulnerability (pre-existed health  services per population), poverty index, history of infectious diseases and  pre-typhoon malnutrition incidence in the affected communities.</p>
              <p><div class="img-holder" style="width:90%">

              </div></p>
                <p>Barangay Santa Juliana recorded the highest malnutrition  rates among children under age five in Tarlac province even before the typhoon.  At the barangay health station, bi-weekly doctor visits are complemented by  local healthcare workers providing acute malnutrition screening and  supplemental feeding, immunisation and community health consultations. Most  patients in this barangay are indigenous <em>Aeta</em> people, like Sari, who live a nomadic life in isolated mountainous communities  of Luzon. Many of them had to walk long distances with young children to reach  the nearest local health facilities.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the response, dengue was considered a  prominent risk to the typhoon-affected population. Dengue cases in Luzon were  already on the rise since earlier in 2015, and prolonged flooding due to the  typhoon was feared to accelerate breeding of mosquitos that transmit the  disease. While dengue cases after the typhoon increased in some of the affected  communities, continuous surveillance and monitoring showed no outbreaks  of dengue or other infectious diseases. </p>
In addition to IMC  providing regular medical visits to different local health facilities, where  over 50 people are treated daily, ACF has deployed mobile health teams to conduct  nutrition screening in hard-to-reach areas of the mountainous communities of  central Luzon. The project has helped to extend health services and disease  surveillance to those who cannot walk far (including the elderly) and also to  adapt the programme to the nomadic nature of <em>Aeta</em> people.

<h3><strong>Addressing residual health needs in post-typhoon recovery and beyond</strong></h3>
                <p>While CERF is effective in addressing acute health needs of  those worst hit by Typhoon Koppu, emergency assistance alone cannot sustain  adequate health services in these communities. Healthcare professionals of Koppu-affected  communities are concerned about what would happen to their patients after May when  the typhoon response programmes are completed. For Sari, only three out of her  five children have undergone nutrition screening so far. Many other mothers are  worried if they could receive essential immunisation and nutrition treatment  for their children before the current assistance ends. </p>
As part of efforts to  mainstream emergency response into regular health programming, WHO is working  closely with the Department of Health and UNICEF to facilitate implementation  of <a href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/Statement_community_based_man_sev_acute_mal_eng.pdf" target="new">Community-based  Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM)</a> schemes in the  Philippines. The initiative aims to integrate into the national health strategy  funds and resources necessary to achieve long-term health in the vulnerable and  remote communities beyond humanitarian response.

              <h2>Cash as an evolving modality of emergency assistance  in the Philippines</h2>
              <p>Cash-transfer  programming (CTP) is not a new modality of assistance to disaster-affected  people in the Philippines. Cash was used in the responses to past major  emergencies including Typhoons Ketsana and Parma (2009), flooding in central  Mindanao (2011), Typhoon Washi (2011) and Typhoon Bopha (2012).</p>
        <p>However,  it was not until Super Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) devastated the  central Philippines – killing 6,300 people and displacing over 4 million- that CTP  was scaled up by both national and international actors. During this response,  at least 45 international aid agencies implemented CTP to address critical  needs of 1.4 million people for shelter, food and livelihoods. UN agencies, Red  Cross and NGOs partnered with the Philippine government and local financial  service providers with long-standing practice of processing the national social  protection programme and remittances of Filipinos. Inter-agency Cash Working Groups (CWG) were set up in Manila,  Guiuan and Roxas to serve as the platform for both strategic and technical  coordination of CTP.</p>
              <p>As aid agencies expanded  direct cash distributions and various cash-for-work schemes, concerns were  raised over possible aid duplication and need for standard-setting on how and  in which sectors CTP should be used. The Manila-based CWG has continually convened  to address these challenges from the height of the typhoon response into the  successive phases of recovery and preparedness for new disasters, capturing key  lessons in CTP implementation.</p>
<p>The Canadian Embassy on 3  March presented its review of Canada-funded NGO projects for humanitarian and early  recovery assistance mostly in Leyte and Eastern Samar provinces following  Typhoon Haiyan. Eleven out of 15 NGOs which received a total funding of C$15.9  million ($11.9 million) reviewed their projects on shelter, livelihood, WASH  and (re)construction of schools and daycare centres. The review cited targeted  provision of time-bound unconditional cash transfers to vulnerable households, strategic  provision of conditional cash transfers coupled with technical assistance to  existing cooperatives and associations with trusted track records, and close  coordination with the national and local authorities in CTP implementation  aimed at strengthening  links between actors in value chains as good practices. </p>
The CWG, with its now over  50 member organisations including UN agencies, NGOs, financial service  providers and government agencies, meets monthly through its 11-bodied Steering Committee and quarterly in a  larger General Assembly. The group&rsquo;s latest activities include development of a  template for new partnership agreements to quickly scale up CTP at the onset of  large-scale disasters and enhanced targeting of CTP beneficiaries based on sex-  and age-disaggregated and other vulnerability data.

              <p><a href="http://www.cashlearning.org/" target="new">Cash Learning Partnership</a>, a key member of the CWG, on 13 February  launched the <a href="http://www.cashlearning.org/advocacy/100-days-of-cash" target="new">100 Days of Cash</a> campaign inviting various stakeholders engaged  in CTP to jointly develop an Agenda for Cash ahead of the <a href="http://worldhumanitariansummit.org/" target="new">World Humanitarian Summit</a>. The campaign aims to bring together voices and  experiences of CTP practitioners and beneficiaries from the Philippines and  elsewhere to establish a &ldquo;framework of action, change and mutual  accountability&rdquo; for cash-based programming as effective means of humanitarian  assistance.</p>
