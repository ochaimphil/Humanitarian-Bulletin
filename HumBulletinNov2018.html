                <h2>Typhoon Yutu follows in the destructive path of Typhoon Mankhut</h2>
                <p>Just a month after Typhoon Mangkhut, the strongest typhoon in the Philippines since Typhoon Haiyan, Typhoon Yutu (locally known as Rosita) entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on 27 October. The typhoon made landfall as a Category-1 storm on 30 October in Dinapigue, Isabela and traversed northern Luzon in a similar path to Typhoon Mankghut. By the afternoon, the typhoon exited the western seaboard province of La Union in the Ilocos region and left the PAR on 31 October. </p>
                <p>Affected communities starting to recover from Typhoon Mangkhut were again evacuated and disrupted, with Typhoon Yutu causing damage to agricultural crops, houses and schools due to flooding and landslides. In Kalinga province, two elementary schools were washed out on 30 October as nearby residents tried to retrieve school equipment and classroom chairs. Homes made with lightweight material were damaged, and in many cases completely destroyed. Over 24,000 homes were affected due to Typhoon Yutu, while over 319,000 homes were affected by Typhoon Manhkhut, which made landfall on 15 September as a Category-5 storm. Landslides made roads impassable and remote communities even harder to reach, and delayed rescue teams and the arrival of humanitarian assistance. Local communities of Abra, Cagayan, Ifugao, Isabela and Mountain Province were affected by the repeated displacement.</p>

                <h3>Compounding the devastating effects of Typhoon Mangkhut</h3>
                <p>As of 8 November, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRMMC) reports that over 66,000 families (more than 259,000 people) were affected by Typhoon Yutu in over 1,400 barangays in the northern part of Luzon, and over 24,000 homes damaged in Regions I, III, III, VIII, and the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). Over 300 people remain in eight evacuation centres.                 
                <p>The International Organization for Migration (IOM) <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/displacement-tracking-matrix-typhoon-mangkhut-site-assessment-philippines-region">reported that evacuation sites were being closed</a> as internally displaced persons (IDPs) are choosing to relocate to home-based sites. Their homes have been damaged due to flooding and landslides particularly in Ucab, Itogon, where reportedly homes have been wiped out by two-story high mudslides. The Government has identifed many of the IDPs’ places of origin and other nearby areas as danger zones and has since restricted their return for their safety. The repeated displacement and damage to homes highlight the need for a permanent and sustainable solution with evacuation centres closing sooner than expected and families moving to home-based sites.
                <p>The NDRRMC has so far confirmed 11 deaths, mostly related to floods and landslides. Media reports state that in Natonin, Mountain Province alone, there are 18 deaths and 12 missing from a landslide that buried a four-storey Department of Public Works and Highways building. The casualties were mostly workers and displaced people who were seeking shelter from the typhoon. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau head Benigno Espejo stated that communities in Natonin may need to be moved to safer areas, as an estimated 90 per cent of the area was landslide-prone due to soil erosion.                 
                <p>The Department of Agriculture (DA) is reporting that as of 7 November, damage and losses from rice and high value crops now total PhP2.89 billion (US$54 million), affecting over 30,000 farmers and fisherfolk, and more than 111,000 ha of agricultural areas in the affected provinces. The estimated volume of production loss is at 144,465 metric tons. The areas affected include Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Ilocos Sur, Pangasinan, Isabela, Quirino, Aurora and Pampanga. Crops that were not destroyed by the previous typhoon are now damaged due to flooding and strong winds.                 
                <p>While most learners have resumed classes and classrooms are no longer being used as evacuation centres, school facilities have sustained damage and equipment has been destroyed. According to the Education cluster, schools that were damaged during Typhoon Haima in 2016 still haven’t been repaired. The repeated disruption of education will have long term effect on the learner’s development. The Department of Education reports that Typhoon Yutu disrupted education in seven regions by either declaring class suspensions or using schools used as evacuation centres, affecting over 15,000 schools and 8.8 million learners. The province of Isabela, where the Typhoon Yutu made landfall, has the most number of schools, with 60 schools used to shelter nearly 700 families.

                <h3>Government and humanitarian response</h3>
                <p>Over 32,000 people were pre-emptively evacuated in low-lying areas, shorelines and landslide prone areas in Regions I, II, III and CAR. Local media reported that more people were willing to evacuate because of the danger they faced during Typhoon Mangkhut. Local and provincial authorities, assisted by the Philippine Red Cross and humanitarian partners, are leading the response, conducting retrieval operations, and continue to clear roads. The Government deployed search and rescue teams composed of members of the Bureau of Fire Protection, the Philippine National Police, and the Department of Public Works and Highways to the affected areas. While electricity was fully restored in Typhoon Mangkhut-affected areas on 26 October, Typhoon Yutu again affected 15 power distribution utilities, mostly cooperatives serving more than more than 4,000 barangays and an estimated 1.5 million households in Regions I, II, III, and CAR.

                </div>
					<p>The Department of Social Work and Development distributed P11 million worth of food and relief items to affected families and on the weekend of 3 November joined the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) and the Department of Health (DOH) in conducting a Rapid Damage Assessment and Needs Analysis (RDANA) in the provinces of Isabela, Quirino, and Nueva Vizcaya. Four teams were deployed to conduct the damage assessment in order to evaluate and determine the needs of the affected families. Disaster teams from DSWD field offices in affected areas continue to assist local authorities in their relief and recovery operations. </p>
					<p>Several humanitarian organizations responding to Typhoon Mangkhutaffected areas and are operational in the region. Among them the Water, Sanitation and Health cluster was responding in Cagayan, while the Child Protection cluster were responding in partnership with Save the Children, covering the Benguet area. The Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) cluster led by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) was also prepositioned in CAR and Cagayan Valley to monitor, assess the impact of Typhoon Yutu and provide quick assistance to DSWD. The Food Security and Agriculture cluster had World Food Programme and Action Against Hunger staff in Benguet, while the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been coordinating with the Department of Agriculture (DA) prior to the typhoon’s landfall to monitor the impact on food security and agriculture sector. </p>
				<p>On 6 November, FAO and the DA deployed a joint team for to validate agricultural damage in Region II. Initial observations report that most of the damage are at the southern portion of Isabela, where hectares of rice farms at reproductive stage had been hit by strong winds, and estimates an 80 to 100 per cent yield loss. Some farmers in the affected regions planted in late June, and had their yield reduced during Typhoon Mangkhut. Typhoon Yutu hit during the maturing stage of their crops. In the aftermath of Typhoon Mangkhut, the DA assisted the typhoon-affected farmers by the activating a Quick Response Fund amounting to $11.2 million (P600 million) for the provision of rice and corn seeds. The DA also made available crop insurance of $30 million (P1.6 billion) and emergency loans.</p>
				<h3>Humanitarian partners update response overview for Northern Luzon typhoons</h3>
                <p>The Humanitarian Country Team, composed of in-country UN agencies, international and national non-governmental organizations, and the private sector working in close coordination with the national and local government conducted a rapid needs assessment for Typhoon Mangkhut on 17 September. Government and humanitarian partners, especially local NGOs gave assessments on Typhoon Yutu’s impact and its effect on the identified needs of communities affected by Typhoon Mangkhut. A Humanitarian Response and Resources Overview for northern Luzon typhoons has been revised to reflect the current needs and priorities based on the impact of both
                Typhoon Yutu and Mangkut. The overview focuses on augmenting national efforts to restore livelihoods, promote rapid recovery of the most vulnerable households through the provision of cash assistance, and rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure. It also focuses on restoring the safety and dignity of affected populations by ensuring they have access to safe housing and basic services. Thirty-one million dollars is sought to provide humanitarian and rapid recovery assistance to 165,000 people in shelter, food security and agriculture, WASH, health, education, and early recovery and livelihoods for six months.

              <h2>A Marawi humanitarian response update</h2>
              <h3>Over 73,000 people remain displaced by Marawi Conflict</h3>
              <p>Repeated displacement is prevalent in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), composed of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, the island provinces of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi provinces and the cities of Marawi and Lamitan. As of 5 October, the <a href="http://www.protectionclusterphilippines.org/?p=1677">Philippine Protection Cluster reports</a> that ARMM has the highest occurrence of displacement due to armed conflict. The Marawi conflict in May 2017 caused large numbers of people to flee, with at least 360,000 people displaced, their homes destroyed and no means of livelihood. As of October 2018, over 73,000 remain displaced, a majority coming from Marawi City’s most affected areas. According to government projections, it will take three to five years to reconstruct this part of the city. </p>
              <p><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/uncertainty-looms-large-over-thousands-still-displaced-marawi">The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reports</a> that displaced families either living with host families, in evacuation centres or in temporary shelters do not have regular access to potable water and proper sanitation facilities. They lack adequate livelihood opportunities, while their children's education remains disrupted. Women, children, elderly and other vulnerable persons of the displaced population will continue to require sustained humanitarian assistance including protection until they can return home.</p>

              </div>
              <h3>Recovery and relocation in Marawi City</h3>
              <p>The DSWD estimates that over 230,000 people have so far returned to Marawi city in 72 Barangays that were partially damaged by the conflict. The returnees need livelihood assistance to meet basic needs including educational and health requirements for their children. Provincial authorities also plan to relocate some of the evacuation centres to temporary sites in Marawi city with limited humanitarian assistance. As the Government looks to rebuilding the city, there is a need to provide for the residual humanitarian needs of the displaced: food, shelter, health, water &amp; sanitation, education and access to social services. </p>
              <p>The most vulnerable of the displaced community such as women and children require targeted programmes to assist them in their recovery. On 8 November, the Department of Health, in partnership with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) established a Women and Children Protection Unit (WCPU) at Amai Pakpak Medical Center in Marawi City. UNFPA provided equipment for the WCPU and supported the 4-6 weeks training of the service providers for managing cases of violence and abuse against women and children. The unit is equipped with a multidisciplinary team composed of doctor, social worker and police personnel trained to provide coordinated services that ensure confidentiality and a survivor-centered approach. This is the first WCPU established in the Lanao del Sur province.</p>

              <h3>Identifying residual humanitarian needs</h3>
              <p>As of October 2018, the food security and agriculture sector has identified a 69 per cent food gap. In the health sector, only six of the fifteen barangay health stations are functional with need for doctors. Inadequate clean water supply and sanitation – in particularly desludging of latrines and hygiene promotion need to be maintained for the displaced people and the returnees. Both transitional shelter and relocations sites will require to be maintained with repairs, particularly those living in tents.</p>
              <p> A protection assessment in August 2018, found that about 18,000 IDPs do not have identification cards and birth registration documents. IDPs need to communication on the status of their displacement, the services available to them, and information about when they can return home. Consultation with displaced communities and provision of information remains important in the return process.</p>
