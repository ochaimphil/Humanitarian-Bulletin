              <h2>World Humanitarian Summit:  Update on Philippine core commitments</h2>
              <p>The upcoming World  Humanitarian Day on 19 August is an opportunity to take the discussion of core commitments  made during the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) in Istanbul, and turn them into  concrete action. At the Summit. the Philippines pledged to sustain  political engagement to address the root causes of conflict by investing in  inclusive and peaceful societies.  The  Philippine delegation also committed to uphold international laws and norms on  human rights, armed conflicts and refugees and to work for the passage of the  Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Bill. In terms of disaster risk reduction,  they stated that the country would accelerate the reduction of disaster and  climate-related risks by: open sharing of risk information and common and  fundamental operational data sets among Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM)  actors across the emergency cycle; capacitating local actors, governments and Civil  Society Organizations (CSOs); and continuing to engage the private sector in disaster  risk reduction initiatives. Lastly, the delegation pledged to enhance financing  and social support to vulnerable communities by implementing disaster risk  financing and increasing investment for risk resilience.</p>

              <h3>Mindanao peace process</h3>
              <p> The current  administration&rsquo;s efforts toward continuing the peace process in Mindanao is a  positive step towards finding political solutions to end conflict. President Rodrigo  Duterte reiterated during his 25 July <a href="http://www.gov.ph/sona-2016/">State of the Nation Address (SONA)</a> his desire to end the decades-long struggle in the southern Philippines,  and to strengthen the government&rsquo;s counter-terrorism programmes. Non-state  armed groups Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic  Liberation Front (MILF) recently signed a joint agreement aimed at coordinating  their separate peace plans with the government.

<h3>IDP and human rights  legislation</h3>
                <p>The IDP bill, which seeks  to protect the rights of those displaced by armed conflict, violence and  natural disasters, was vetoed in 2013. Citing issues with the constitutionality  of certain provisions, the bill failed to be passed by the Aquino  administration. In May 2016, however, President   Aquino signed the <a href="http://www.gov.ph/2016/05/18/republic-act-no-10821/">Children&rsquo;s Emergency  Relief and Protection Act</a>, a law improving  care and protection for children affected by disasters. The law requires an  increased surveillance against child trafficking and other violence against  children in the aftermath of disasters and calamities.  The act also sets a system in place of  restoring civil documents for children and their families, and protection  against exploitation. Presently, efforts at legislation aimed at protecting  human rights and those displaced were <a href="http://www.manilatimes.net/roque-sees-passage-of-health-care-whistleblower-bills/276174/">recently filed  by Representative Harry Roque</a>.  On 30 July, the congressman filed  House Bill 222, which seeks to protect the rights of IDPs, and House Bill 226, which  seeks to amend Republic Act 10368 or the Human Rights Victims Reparation and  Recognition Act of 2013.</p>
                <h3>Commitment to environmental  protection</h3>
                <p>Disaster preparedness and climate change advocates are  taking note of the administration&rsquo;s priorities in environmental concerns,  lauding the appointment of environmental activist Gina Lopez as the head of the  Department of the Environment and Natural Resources. President Duterte  reiterated in his SONA the administration&rsquo;s commitment to reviewing permits  granted to mining and logging companies. Compliance with environmental regulations  is a significant aspect of mitigating disasters. The impact of earthquakes,  floods and typhoons are all heightened when forests are denuded and waterways  are poisoned by chemicals.</p>
                <h3>Engaging local actors and  the private sector</h3>
              <p>The participation of Civil Society Organizations  (CSOs) in the <a href="https://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org/">World  Humanitarian Summit</a> was a welcome opportunity for local humanitarian  actors to reaffirm their important role in disaster preparedness, response and  resilience. Calling it the &ldquo;Balik-Bayan&rdquo; strategy<br>
 (a term used by  CSOs to denote localising humanitarian response) , their consortium of networks  in the Philippines stressed the importance of local partners in the overall  disaster preparedness and humanitarian response.  On 28 June 2016, the consortium invited UN  agencies, international non-government organizations and the private sector for  a post-WHS feedback forum. In the resulting action plan, the feedback forum  underscored some policy gaps on localizing the humanitarian response and  limited avenues to make use of the existing humanitarian response platforms to  engage the CSOs. </p>
              <p>Maria Fellizar-Cagay, Lead Convener for the Disaster  Risk Reduction Network Philippines (DRRNetPhils) said during the forum that  &ldquo;for us local NGOs and CSOs, we are advocating for a Balik-Bayan approach to  strengthen our humanitarian and preparedness work. We want to make use of the  existing response mechanisms and provide inclusive opportunities to form  partnerships in support of local humanitarian actors&rdquo;.  </p>
              <p>The World Humanitarian Summit generated new momentum  to move the Agenda for Humanity to deliver better for people. Working to fulfill the core commitments will  be a global effort and everyone, from the highest level of Government to  affected communities, to ordinary citizens will have a role to play.  World Humanitarian Day, and the upcoming  United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on 19 September 2016, will  be meaningful opportunities to champion commitments made. </p>

              <h2>La Niña watch in  Maguindanao province</h2>
              <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <p>After long months of drought, the intermittent rains in April this year  enabled farmers in themunicipality of Kabuntalan, Maguindanao province to take  the opportunity to plant their crops with hopes of recovering their losses from  previous months.  But just two weeks  short of harvesting, monsoon rains in June submerged the fields, destroying  their crops. The municipal authorities attribute the problem to the need for  improved flood control measures and a community master plan to address their  long-term development needs. For local government, until these needs are  addressed, farmers will continue to be affected by flooding.</p>
              <p><div class="img-holder">

              </div></p>
              <h3>Farming in Kabuntalan</h3>
<p>Kabuntalan is located in a marsh  area that frequently floods. Two major rivers, the Tamontaka and Kabuntalan, pass  through this area.  There have been times  when even with no rainfall in the municipality, floodwaters still came, mainly  flowing from nearby areas. The Municipal Agriculture Officer stressed that  farmers are at the mercy of increasingly unpredictable weather systems and  other environmental concerns. The challenge of estimating the best planting  time affects their level of preparation for the possible onslaught of La  Niña.   </p>
<p>The communities&rsquo; main sources of  livelihood are fishing and farming. With frequently overflowing riverbanks,  municipal officials are already considering long-term fishery projects as an  alternative livelihood for agricultural farmers.</p>
<p>Farming in Kabuntalan is  rain-fed and, as part of preparation for La Niña, the Municipal Agriculture Officer  advised the communities to plant early maturing varieties of crops.  But some farmers have lost hope in farming. </p>
<h3>Extent of crop damage</h3>
<p> &ldquo;As of 4 July, 205 hectares (ha) of farmland  planted with corn, rice, mung beans and assorted vegetables were affected by  the flooding.  Of these, the provincial  Department of Agriculture says about 108 ha have no chance of recovery. The  municipal government is expecting the number to rise as more farmers report  damage.</p>
<p>Akmad Toni, 32 years old, planted his 3 ha of rented farmland with corn  in May this year, during the anticipated planting season. He took out loans to  pay the P5,100 (US$110) rent on the land and purchase bags of seeds. He is  expecting to harvest 50 to 60 sacks per hectare and earn  P20,000 ($435) per hectare.  The selling price of corn ranges from P10 to  P14 ($0.22 to $0.30) per kilogram depending on the time of year. But, when the  corn crops were already in the vegetative stage, floodwaters submerged all his  hard work and investment.  About half of  his farmland is totally damaged.  This is  his third successive seasonal loss and he is having difficulty getting out of  debt. &ldquo;Even faced with this and having been told about La Niña,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I  will still farm and take my chances, because there is nothing else I count on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Akmad&rsquo;s wife works as a volunteer teacher. They have two young children,  ages 2 and 3 years old. Despite the repeated hardships, Akmad remains hopeful  that one day he reaps enough to sustain their daily needs.</p>

              <h2>Reflecting on rapid response projects after Typhoon  Koppu</h2>
              <h3>Typhoon Koppu and  international response</h3>
              <p>In October 2015, central  and northern Luzon were inundated by heavy rains from Typhoon Koppu (known  locally as Lando), a Category-3 storm that was the most destructive typhoon  that year, displacing over a million people at the height of the disaster and  causing over $200 million damage to agriculture.</p>
              <p><div class="img-holder">
                <img src="assets/images/HBJuly2016_FAO.jpg">
                <div class="caption">Candaba, Pampanga, 29  December 2015. FAO, DA, and OCHA representatives oversee distribution of rice  seeds after Typhoon Koppu. Credit: OCHA/M. Koide.</div>
              </div></p>
        <p>In the wake of the typhoon,  international aid agencies participated in a multi-sectoral rapid damage  assessment and needs analysis led by the Government. While overall the  Government was able to respond to the needs of the affected people, some  agencies identified procurement processes and other gaps that were hindering  their ability to rapidly provide the assistance required. The <a href="http://www.da.gov.ph/">Departments of Agriculture</a> (DA) and <a href="http://www.doh.gov.ph/">Health</a> (DOH) turned toward their strong relationships with the Country Offices  of the <a href="http://www.fao.org/philippines/en/">Food and Agriculture  Organization</a> (FAO) and <a href="http://www.fao.org/philippines/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) for support.</p>
        
              <h3>Utilizing the Central  Emergency Response Fund for coordinated rapid response</h3>
              <p>FAO and WHO  coordinated closely with their Government counterparts to develop projects that  would serve the most-affected communities in four provinces in the central  region to mitigate food insecurity and address urgent risks of malnutrition and  diseases among the affected communities. <br>
In November 2015, the  UN<a href="mailto:http://www.unocha.org/cerf/"> Central Emergency Response  Fund (CERF)</a> awarded $1.5 million toward these projects. Just over  one million went to FAO, which added another half million dollars of its own  funding. Still, this was well short of the nearly $5 million it required to fully  implement its project. WHO also added about $200,000 of other funding to their  project, but fell short of the $900,000 it estimated was needed.</p>
With these funding shortfalls, the agencies, together with their  Government counterparts and local stakeholders, developed strategic criteria to  prioritize assistance based on the most urgent needs and the capacities of the  line agencies to respond to maximize their impact and avoid duplicating  efforts. Additionally, WHO relied on international non-governmental  organization (INGO) partners, such as <a href="http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/countries/asia/philippines">Action  Against Hunger (ACF)</a>, <a href="https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/philippines">International  Medical Corps</a> and the <a href="http://www.ifrc.org/en/noticias/noticias/asia-pacific/philippines/">International  Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)</a> to augment local health authorities&rsquo; efforts to help implement its  project.
              <h3>Reflecting on project results  and lessons learned</h3>
              <p>FAO initially  targeted 13,000 farming families, or approximately 65,000 people, with rice  seeds and fertilizer, but managed to help an additional 9,700 families with  just fertilizer, helping a total of 113,500 people by the end of their project.  At the same time, WHO reached its target of serving 212,000 people with mobile  health services. Further, during its project, nearly 7,000 children were  screened for acute malnutrition. Of those screened, less than 40 were  identified with acute malnutrition, and 35 of those were managed at the  community level. Both FAO and WHO report  that partnership terms and arrangements among  stakeholders were strengthened  through emergency response activities. The collaborative relationships also  afforded refinements in the implementation arrangements. Most importantly, the  projects supported local government initiatives and complemented the  Government&rsquo;s efforts for early recovery and livelihoods.</p>
</p>
              <p>A good practice that emerged was coupling  coordination with national government agencies and close collaboration with  local governments to facilitate implementing project activities. These actions  were critical to more precise targeting of beneficiaries while avoiding service  overlaps and wasting precious resources. This allowed for more efficient  response. Participation of beneficiaries in the relief and rehabilitation  process was important in promoting ownership and empowerment. Doing this during  rapid response in the days and weeks following a disaster had its own  challenges, but participatory, inclusive planning with project stakeholders  ensured response activities were tailor fit to the felt needs and conditions of  the beneficiaries. As FAO and WHO learned, the process for targeting  beneficiaries must be flexible to accommodate unforeseen changes in  vulnerability patterns, needs and local contexts. </p>

              </div></p>
<p>Another good practice,  particularly noted by FAO, is that even though these were rapid response  projects, planning for recovery from the onset was imperative. Through the  provision of seeds and other farm inputs, the DA and FAO laid the path for  restoration of livelihoods and recovery of the affected families. FAO has  recognized the need to constantly build capacity, promote more accountable ways  of working and lead reflective action amongst project partners at all levels.</p>
