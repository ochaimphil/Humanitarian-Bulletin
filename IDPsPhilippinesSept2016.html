        <h2>The Philippines, with a unique history of embracing refugees, turns inward to address IDPs</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On     19 September, the <a href="https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/" target="_blank">UN Summit on Refugees and Migrants</a> took  place at the UN Headquarters in New York on the heels of the 16th annual <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/refugeeday/" target="_blank">World Refugee Day</a>. This is the first  time a high-level summit involving the Heads of State and Government will take  place, providing a unique opportunity to develop a better system for governing  migration and responding to large movements of <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/refugeeday/background.shtml" target="_blank">refugees  and migrants</a>. Earlier this year, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refugeeday/" target="_blank">UN  Refugee Agency</a>&nbsp;launched a petition to that will be presented at this summit to tell  governments they must work together and do their share for&nbsp;refugees.</p>
        
          <h3>Welcoming  refugees from abroad</h3><br>
        
          <p>Since  the early 20th century, the Philippines has welcomed multitudes of refugees  from around the world when other nations would not, and has actively engaged to  resettle them. Bernard Kerblat, former&nbsp;<a href="http://unhcr.ph/" target="_blank">UNHCR  Representative in the Philippines</a>, extensively researched the history of asylum seekers in the  Philippines.</p>
<p>          Kerblat  notes the country&rsquo;s modern history of welcoming refugees and stateless people  began within a few decades of its independence from Spain and subsequent  occupation by the United States. In 1923, the first group to seek refuge in the  Philippines arrived as part of a larger diaspora of &ldquo;White Russians&rdquo; escaping  the Communist Red Army. Most of the 800 exiles were subsequently transferred to the United States (US), but some chose to  remain. </p>
<p>          From that point until the beginning of this century, conflicts resulting from the spread  of fascism, communism and imperialism across Europe and Asia spawned successive  waves of refugees. In the years leading up to and during World War II, the  Philippines opened its doors to European <a href="http://www.gov.ph/1939/02/15/statement-president-quezon-on-jewish-settlement-in-mindanao-february-15-1939/" target="_blank">Jews</a>, Spanish Republicans fleeing civil war and <a href="http://www.gov.ph/1937/08/21/proclamation-no-173-s-1937/" target="_blank">foreigners</a> and <a href="http://www.gov.ph/1940/07/01/proclamation-no-570-s-1940/" target="_blank">Chinese</a> escaping the invading Japanese. In 1940, the  country enacted its first <a href="http://www.gov.ph/1940/08/26/commonwealth-act-no-613/" target="_blank">law</a> to regulate immigration, which limited the  annual number of immigrants to 500 of any one nationality. It included,  however, a provision that remains codified in the law that allows the president  &ldquo;to admit aliens who are refugees for religious, political or racial reasons.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>         The latter half of the 20th century saw  significant increases in the number of refugees seeking asylum in the  Philippines. Between 1949 and 1951, more than 6,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/BQSl3ECgQrg" target="_blank">White Russians</a> escaping Communist rule in China  were settled near Guiuan, Eastern Samar, making it one of  the largest refugee camps in Philippine history. Then conflicts in Vietnam,  Cambodia and Laos brought two successive waves of refugees. From 1975 to 1992  about 400,000 Indochinese refugees passed through processing centres in Palawan  and <a href="http://www.gov.ph/1980/01/21/speech-of-president-macros-during-the-inauguration-of-the-philippine-refugee-processing-center/" target="_blank">Bataan</a>.</p>
<p>          In between, the 1979 Iranian Revolution led several  thousand Iranians studying in the Philippines to seek refugee status due to the  regime change in their country. By the early 1990s, Iranians formed the  majority of non-Indochinese refugees in the country. In 2000, some 600 people  from East Timor flee to the Philippines in 2000 to escape the violence of its  war of independence from Indonesia. The refugees were repatriated after  security was restored. Finally, as recently as May 2015, the Government said it  is open to <a href="http://pcoo.gov.ph/may-18-2015-news-releases/#Philippines_remains" target="_blank">sheltering Rohingya  refugees</a> from Myanmar. </p>
          <h3>The  humanitarian environment in the Philippines</h3><br>
          <p>In spite of the Philippines&rsquo; rich history welcoming  refugees, it struggles with the recurrent displacement of its own people by  conflict and natural disasters. While there are no official figures on <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IDPersons/Pages/Issues.aspx" target="_blank">internal displacement</a>, UNHCR notes cumulatively  4.7 million people have been forcibly displaced since 2012 in the southern island  group of Mindanao by re-emerging armed conflicts and cyclical natural disasters  that affect the area. In 2015 alone, over 400,000 people in Mindanao were  forced to flee, with one in ten of those on a repeat basis, by conflict, <em>rido </em>(clan feuds) or generalized  violence.</p>
<p>        As part of these conflicts, issues with retaliatory  house burning, land grabbing and attacks on schools regularly emerge. There are  also reports of discrimination in the provision of assistance to those who have  been displaced, recruitment of children and even killing and torture by all  parties to the conflict.</p>

<p>OCHA Philippines maintains  a sub-office in Cotabato City, in proximity to central Mindanao, where extended  and repeated displacements occur the most due to armed conflict, rido and  military operations in one of the poorest parts of the country. The staff  members at the sub-office actively monitor internal displacements, evacuation  and transition sites, and regularly engage with affected people, local  governments, non-governmental organizations and other UN agencies operating in  Mindanao to advocate for the needs of the internally displaced people (IDP). </p>
<p>  The Government  of the Philippines has not been ignoring this issue. At the World Humanitarian  Summit in Instanbul, Turkey, in May, former <a href="http://www.dswd.gov.ph/2016/05/ph-shares-disaster-management-experience-in-1-st-world-humanitarian-summit-in-turkey/" target="_blank">Department of Social Welfare and Development</a> Secretary Corazon Soliman <a href="http://webtv.un.org/watch/corazon-soliman-philippines-world-humanitarian-summit-istanbul-2016-member-states-and-stakeholders-announcements/4907734504001" target="_blank">announced</a> the  Philippines&rsquo; commitments to the five <a href="http://www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/core-responsibilities-foundation-world-humanitarian-summit" target="_blank">Core Responsibilities</a> of the UN&rsquo;s <a href="http://sgreport.worldhumanitariansummit.org/" target="_blank">Agenda for Humanity</a>, including to  uphold international laws and norms on human rights, armed conflict and  refugees. The Philippines is also a signatory to the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html" target="_blank">1951 Convention  Relating to the Status of Refugees</a> and the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3bbb25729.html" target="_blank">1954 Convention  Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons</a>. </p>
<p> <h3> A law to protect IDPs in the  Philippines </h3></p>
<p>  While only about <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/idp/resources/idp-policies-index">two dozen countries around  the world have laws</a> protecting the rights of the internally displaced,  the Philippines has yet been unsuccessful in its own attempts to pass a bill on  the rights of its own populations displaced internally by conflict and natural  disasters. In 2013, Congress  passed its first IDP protection bill, which was subsequently vetoed by the president,  saying some of its provisions were questionable.</p>
<p>  &ldquo;The Philippines is working to pass the country&rsquo;s IDP  bill,&rdquo; Soliman said at <a href="http://webtv.un.org/meetings-events/conferencessummits/world-humanitarian-summit-23-24-may-2016-istanbul-turkey/high-level-leaders-roundtables/watch/hl-leaders-roundtable-3-%E2%80%93-leaving-no-one-behind-a-commitment-to-address-forced-displacement-world-humanitarian-summit-23-24-may-2016-istanbul-turkey/4907687615001" target="_blank">a roundtable to address  forced displacement</a> at the World Humanitarian Summit. &ldquo;[It] will define  the roles and responsibilities of different government bodies in addressing the  needs of affected communities and will help identify conflict drivers and the  root causes of vulnerability. The IDP bill&rsquo;s provisions are aligned with  international standards, but at the same time culturally sensitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  The <a href="https://www.senate.gov.ph/lisdata/2148718237!.pdf" target="_blank">2015 iteration</a> of the bill was not voted  on before the Congress recessed in June. However, shortly after the 17th Congress convened, <a href="http://www.harryroque.com/">Representative  Herminio Harry L Roque, Jr.</a>, filed a <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB00222.pdf" target="_blank">revised version</a> of the bill  with the House of Representatives. </p>
<p>  The latest bill  made only minor substantive changes. Of note, it removes &quot;any armed group,  including non-state actors&quot;, limiting the scope of its application to just  government entities. The bill also broadens the scope of prohibited acts of  arbitrary internal displacement and adds the requirement that basic shelter and  housing conform to the National Building Code of the Philippines.</p>
 <p> One of the  reasons given for the president&rsquo;s veto of the first bill in 2013 was the amount  of power it gave to the Commission on Human Rights. The latest version requires  the commission to closely coordinate with the military, law enforcement  agencies and other national and local government agencies to ensure it does not  act unilaterally. Conversely, the bill removes language requiring international  humanitarian organizations from coordinating with local and national government  agencies. </p>
<p>  Finally, the  bill adds a representative of IDP-oriented human rights non-governmental  organizations and other human rights groups to the compliance monitoring  committee, the only non-governmental representation on the committee. </p>
<p>Since 26 July, the House bill&rsquo;s status is pending with  the Committee on Human Rights.</p>
