                <h2>Typhoon Nock-Ten preparedness and response</h2>
                <p>Violent winds, intense rains and massive flooding were not the gifts Filipinos were expecting as Typhoon Nock-Ten (locally named Nina) slammed into the Philippines on Christmas Day, disrupting holiday celebrations for millions of people. </p>
                <p>Packing maximum sustained winds of 185 km/h and gusts of up to 255 km/h, Nock-Ten made landfall in Catanduanes province and in seven other areas, leaving a trail of destruction which resulted in 13 deaths and several still missing. More than 393,000 houses were damaged, of which more than 98,000 are destroyed. Up to PhP6 billion (US$122 million) worth of agricultural crops and infrastructure were destroyed in the affected areas of the Bicol Region.</p>
                <p>With the country still recovering from Typhoon Haima (locally named Lawin) which battered northern and central Luzon in October, Nock-Ten again tested the response capacities of government and humanitarian organizations. Disaster management officials were pressed to convince the people to abandon their Christmas celebrations and head for evacuation shelters. More than 400,000 people heeded the call and were evacuated across 18 provinces after local officials imposed forced evacuations and offered enticements such as free Christmas dinners at evacuation sites.</p>

                <h3>Good practices and lessons learned from typhoon emergencies</h3>
                <p>Disaster preparedness and response capacities of the Government have significantly increased over the years. The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), through OCHA, is an active participant in the Government’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council’s (NDRRMC) pre-disaster risk assessment meetings, contributing to better coordination and a greater understanding of the Government’s planning scenario and preparedness actions. 
                <p>To support the Government in its response to Typhoon Nock-Ten, the HCT took stock of in-country pre-positioned relief items that can be readily mobilized, mapped the presence of humanitarian organizations and partners in the likely affected areas, and developed profiles of areas impacted. The timely information – in the form of updates, infographics, and an assessment report of the humanitarian situation – was widely shared among partners.              
                <p>Building on this experience, the HCT is strengthening its inter-agency preparedness through contingency planning. The process looks at the operational response to a catastrophic typhoon scenario, reviewing the members’ roles and responsibilities. The exercise sees cluster lead agencies taking an active role in coordinating preparedness efforts, ensuring close coordination with their government counterparts. The planning process also provides the HCT with an understanding of in-country capacity and operational gaps. The plan is in its final stages and includes the development of a prepopulated template for a flash appeal which can be quickly finalised if the government requests international assistance.               
                <p>Coordinating with the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) and the NDRRMC was valuable especially in clarifying the Government’s operational policy for the typhoon responses at the national and local levels. As a result, the HCT was able to rapidly deploy field teams, which were instrumental in gaining first-hand information of the situation on the ground and placed it in a position to assist with coordination and planning the response.
                  
                <h3>Areas for improvement</h3>
                <p>Nock-Ten and other recent typhoons of similar scale have shown Government and the humanitarian agencies have considerable capacity to rapidly provided assistance during and immediately after a crisis. The clusters and members of the HCT working groups, however, have highlighted a number of recurring issues needing attention, particularly with respect to engaging international assistance and responding to bilateral requests.               
                <p>Other needs include the development of a framework for conducting joint assessments and the planning for early recovery and rehabilitation, doing more to lay the groundwork for speedy and sustainable rebuilding of lives and livelihoods.

              <h2>Preparedness helps achieve zero casualties for Barangay Buenavista</h2>
              <p>Buenavista, a remote, mountainous barangay of the town of Bato, Catanduanes, is familiar with the catastrophic effects typhoons can have. But, when Typhoon Nock-Ten made its first landfall in Bato, Buenavista did not suffer any casualties as people had evacuated safely. Damage was mainly to homes, especially ones made of light materials, and to abaca (hemp) farm lands. This culture of preparedness did not emerge overnight. The 400-plus residents of Buenavista learned the hard way.</p>
              <p><div class="img-holder" >
                <img src="assets/images/HBJanFeb2017_Barangay Captain.jpg" title="Barangay chairman at the community's evacuation centre">
                <div class="caption"> Credit: OCHA/G. Arevalo Barangay Buenavista, Bato, Catanduanes (29 December 2016) - Barangay chairman Candido Timola outside the community's evacuation centre</div></div></p>
              <h3>A community prioritizes disaster preparation</h3>
              <p>Relying on its strong local knowledge and experience in previous disasters, the current barangay chairman, Candido Timola, prioritized a community project that would enhance its community resiliency. </p>
              <p>“I was a kid around 1970 when this barangay was hit by Typhoon Joan (Sening). I remember that most, if not all, of the houses were destroyed. I think only about three houses survived. We had no choice but to seek shelter with neighbours in sturdier houses. There was a deadly landslide that caused several casualties, too,” Timola said.</p>
              <p>Over 700 people in the Philippines died from Typhoon Joan, which made landfall on 11 October 1970 and is considered one of the most intense storms to ever hit the Bicol region. </p>
              <p>When funding became available from the national government last year, Timola added, it was an easy decision for him and his constituents to build a safe permanent evacuation centre. Doing so became a good practice recognized by the town and the province. The building was finished just in time on 20 December and was immediately put to test when Typhoon Nock-Ten struck on Christmas Day.</p>
              <h3>Recovery and livelihood concerns</h3>
              <p>Jessalyn Bernacer, mother of two, described her experience. “The wind and rain were really strong. We were lucky to get out of the house in time, with me carrying my two kids. We stayed and slept here [at the evacuation centre]. Of course, even if you say we’re used to being hit by storms here, we were still afraid. We were packed in here, but at least we were all safe and really looking out for each other.” </p>
              <p>While avoiding any casualties after every disaster is the ultimate goal of Buenavista, just like other parts of Catanduanes, the barangay is desperate for countermeasures that will help save their livelihoods. It will take two to three years before abaca plantations can fully recover. While there are alternative means of livelihood to tide most residents over, affected communities would like to focus on creating a local system that will better warn them to protect their livelihoods before any natural hazard strikes. </p>
              <p>Dolly Tolledo, a mother of four, expressed her concern. “At this point, our situation is really difficult, especially when a strong typhoon hits us. We know how to protect ourselves, but we can’t do anything if our livelihood is destroyed.”</p>

              <h2>Augmenting agricultural assistance to Typhoon Sarika and Haima-affected farmers</h2>
              <p>In the aftermath of a typhoon, food security and rural livelihoods are severely disrupted. It can take many months, even years, for farmers and croplands to recover. Two typhoons that occured in October 2016 have greatly damaged crops that feed the entire country. </p>
              <p>Typhoon Sarika (local named Karen) made landfall in Aurora Province on 16 October and crossed central Luzon. Three days later, Typhoon Haima (locally named Lawin) crossed a similar path. The total damage and losses in the agriculture sector were estimated at $236 million. Rice, the hardest-hit sub-sector, accounts for over 75 per cent of the damage. At least 343,600 ha of rice land and 118,000 farming households across seven regions of the country were affected. Approximately 516,000 tons of rice, which could have fed over 4.5 million people for a year, were lost.</p>

              <h3>Damage to the agriculture sector</h3>
              <p>The country’s rice granary, Region III (Central Luzon), hit by typhoons Koppu and Melor a year ago, once again bore the brunt of the disaster. Of the 66,720 farmers affected in the region, 43,180 are in Aurora and Nueva Ecija provinces. Those who were engaged in backyard gardening also lost their vegetables and some production assets such as hand tools.</p>
              <h3>Supporting Government-led response</h3>
              <p>At the request of the Government, FAO is augmenting the resources delivered by the Department of Agriculture (DA) to help ensure that the most affected and most vulnerable farming households are able to harvest rice between March and April 2017. Additionally, they will be able to produce vegetables that will further promote crop diversification, improve incomes, contribute to household nutrition and maximize the role of women and children in household food production and security.</p>
              <p> “Without timely and adequate assistance, the production capacity and food security of affected agricultural communities would further deteriorate, translating to low incomes in the coming cropping season and overall reduced supply of staple food,” said FAO Representative in the Philippines José Luis Fernández.</p>
              <p>At least 4,300 farming families in the provinces of Aurora and Nueva Ecija are expected to receive fertilizer, open pollinated vegetable seeds and hand tools from FAO’s emergency livelihood recovery and rehabilitation project. These complement the rice seeds and other inputs provided by DA.</p>

              <h2>Flooding displaces thousands in northern Mindanao and southern Visayas</h2>
              <p>Since 8 January, four successive weather systems have affected much of Mindanao and parts of the Visayas regions. The first was the only one to strengthen into just a tropical depression as it traversed the southern Philippine islands, but flash flooding caused by the heavy rainfall from these storms has displaced a total of over 300,000 people and so far has damaged 583 homes and destroyed 681. As of 30 January, over 92,000 people were still displaced, a third of them in evacuation centres. The hardest hit areas were the provinces of Misamis Oriental in Region X and Agusan del Sur in the Caraga region, accounting for 57 per cent of the total displaced. </p>
              <p>Rural communities along rivers, lakes and coastal areas were affected. Notably, the entire populations of coastal towns of Bien Unido in Bohol, (28,140 people) and Lugait, Misamis Oriental, (20,900 people) were at one point evacuated. More than 26,000 people, or 80 per cent of the population of the mountainous town of San Luis, Agusan del Sur, are still displaced, according to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). But, it was flash flooding in urbanized areas like Cagayan de Oro City, which took many by surprise. Comparisons have been made to Typhoon Ketsana (locally named Ondoy) that also quickly flooded parts of Metro Manila in September 2009. With limited early warning and preparedness to evacuate, to date nine deaths have been confirmed by the Government as a result of flash floods. Four hundred sixty-four deaths were officially tallied in the Philippines after Typhoon Ketsana.</p>

              <h3>Investing in community preparedness</h3>
              <p>Rainfall amounts in the Visayas and northern and western parts of Mindanao have been up to 20 per cent above normal in the first two weeks of January, according to the Philippines’ national meteorological authority, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. (PAGASA). Wet weather is not unusual for the months of December through February, and the potential impact of these rains should not be unexpected.</p>
              <p>Over the past decade, national and local disaster management authorities have been investing in community disaster preparedness, and it has paid off. Generally, there are fewer casualties now from tropical cyclones and other hydrometeorological hazards that affect the Philippines annually thanks to greater awareness of the potential impact of storms, effective early warning, and stronger compliance with preevacuation orders.</p>

              <h2>Successful return of a displaced community</h2>
              <p>In early September 2016, a year after fleeing their homes for safety, over 2,000 indigenous peoples (IPs) or Lumads from Mindanao returned home. In <a href="http://ochaimphil.github.io/Humanitarian-Bulletin/HumBulletinSept2015.html#three" target="_blank">August and September 2015</a>, more than 4,000 IPs in the province of Surigao del Sur sought refuge from harassment and killings allegedly perpetrated by paramilitary groups. They fled to safer ground to other municipalities. About 3,000 IPs were hosted in Tandag Sports Complex in Tandag City for one year.</p>
              <h3>Government-led inclusive process</h3>
              <p>Over the course of a year, the provincial government and IP leaders sought to resolve issues of displacement and facilitate safe return to their places of origin. However, both parties could not come up with acceptable conditions. Although some of the displaced people agreed to return, a majority opted to stay in the sports complex in fear of their safety. To find solutions, the government led consultations with different stakeholders such as non-governmental organizations, faith-based institutions, and affected people. The provincial authorites, together with partners and community leaders, ensured the safe and dignified return of IPs to their communities. A dialogue was organized with IP leaders and the province’s social welfare office to identify their concerns and needs while still at the Tandag Sports Center.</p>
              <p>Through this effort, an initial plan of action was crafted. The provincial government called a meeting to plan and coordinate reintegration on 11 August 2016, attended by government agencies, community leaders, religious organizations, NGOs and civil society organizations. The process resulted in an agreement to hold an on-site validation activity for the IP communities in the province. Findings from the validation activity were then presented to the group and the action plan finalized. To implement the agreement with the affected people, a ceremonial pull-out of military presence in the community was conducted that eventually facilitated the return of the IPs to their homes the following day on 3 September. For their trip home, the IDPs were provided with food packs, kitchen utensils, hygiene kits and transportation support. The actual return was smoothly and successfully facilitated by the provincial government and other partners. Over 2,573 IPs returned to their municipalities of Tago, San Miguel; Lianga,San Augustin; and Marihatag in the province of Surigao Del Sur.</p>

UNHCR accompanied the IDPs back to their communities and provided tarpaulins for temporary shelter while damaged dwellings were being repaired.</div></div>
              <h3>Rehabilitation of villages damaged by conflict</h3>
              <p>The provincial authorities continue to support the IP communities who have returned home. An inter-agency assessment was conducted on 15 September that identified priority areas of need. DSWD distributed food packs, implemented a cashfor- work programme, and gave emergency shelter assistance worth P10,000 ($200) for qualified families. Medical assistance was provided by the Department of Health.</p>
              <p>Upon their return, they found the villages that they had left behind were badly in need of repair. Their farmlands had been neglected, and infrastructure was damaged. A fallen bridge was fixed by local authorities, and a water system in Barangay Diatagon, Lianga was rehabilitated. The Red Cross, IOM, Action Against Hunger, Save the Children, UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies provided support to the families who have returned home to help them start their livelihood as well as support the education of returnees’ children. </p>
              <p>The dignified process of return, giving premium to the voices of the affected people, is a step towards attaining peace in Mindanao, and gives hope to other displaced people waiting to return to their places of origin. Continued dialogue and consultation with affected communities could eventually lead to peaceful and successful return and reintegration of the displaced to their habitual residences.</p>

              <h2>In brief: The forecast ahead</h2>
              <p>On 18 January, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) hosted its 88th Climate Outlook Forum where it presented its forecasts for February through July 2017. </p>
              <p>La Niña-like conditions will continue, bringing wet conditions potentially impacting floodand landslide-prone areas of the country, and El Niño Southern Oscillation-neutral conditions will last through February 2017. What does this mean in layman’s terms? The surface air temperature over the Pacific Ocean is near normal—neither warm (El Niño) nor cool (La Niña)—but meteorologists will continue to monitor the weak La Niña, which brings cooler temperatures, stronger winds from the east, and more cloudy weather to the Philippines. </p>
              <p>Looking forward, rainfall amounts for most of the Philippines will be about normal in February and March, while above normal for part of Luzon south of Metro Manila, southern Bicol, Western Visayas, and the central parts of Mindanao. Conditions may trigger floods and landslides in vulnerable areas and storm surges in coastal communities in these areas. Meanwhile, rainfall will be up to 40 per cent below normal for extreme northwestern parts of the country and the northern part of Palawan island. </p>
              <p>As April approaches, rainfall amounts nationwide are predicted to return to normal or even fall below normal before picking up again in May, then stabilizing for June and July. One tropical cyclone can possibly form or pass through the Philippines’ area of responsibility monthly from February to April. From May to July, the forecast is for one up to three cyclones per month.</p>
