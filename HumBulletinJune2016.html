              <h2>Philippines: civil-military  coordination in humanitarian response</h2>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/gar/2015/en/home/data.php?iso=PHL">Philippines</a>, by virtue of its location, is <a href="http://www.inform-index.org/Countries/Country-profiles/iso3/PHL">prone to natural disasters</a>. With the trend of increasingly severe  and destructive weather disturbances unlikely to change, more communities are likely  to be exposed to hazards. </p>
              <p> The  country has thus developed a comprehensive <a href="http://www.ndrrmc.gov.ph/attachments/article/41/NDRRM_Plan_2011-2028.pdf">disaster management system</a> utilized down to the local level to  ensure preparedness, effective response and prompt recovery. When a disaster overwhelms national  capacity, however, the Philippines may request international assistance,  including military assets, to support the national response.</p>
 After Typhoon Haiyan (known  locally as Yolanda) in 2013, military assets consisting of air, naval, medical,  engineering and communications capacities, as well as personnel were deployed from <a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/philippines-foreign-military-deployed-assets-30-december-2013">21 Member States</a>. Thousands of foreign military personnel worked closely with the  humanitarian community at the height of the relief operation. With overlapping  capabilities and specific missions coupled with cultural differences, the  arrival of foreign militaries posed coordination challenges with civilian  humanitarian actors.            </div><!-- /.col-sm-8 -->

              <h3><strong>The military&rsquo;s role in  humanitarian response</strong></h3>
              <p> In the Asia-Pacific region,  military resources are often part of the first response after natural disasters  and make a valuable contribution. The prominent engagement of the military in  humanitarian operations is a by-product of its unique structure, discipline,  training, manpower, equipment and the determination to bolster resilience  amidst the chaos.              
              <p>Coordination  among the different actors is critical for sharing information, planning  and dividing tasks. This  is where the <a href="http://www.unocha.org/what-we-do/coordination-tools/UN-CMCoord/overview">United Nations&rsquo; Humanitarian  Civil-Military Coordination</a> framework helps facilitate interaction between civilian and military  actors, which is essential to protect humanitarian principles, avoid  competition, minimize inconsistency and pursue common goals.               
              <p>In the event of a disaster, the Government and affected communities rely  on the <a href="http://www.afp.mil.ph/">Armed Forces of the Philippines</a> (AFP) to be among the first to respond. The AFP has as one of its  critical mission areas <a href="http://carlospromulo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AFP-Briefing.pdf">Humanitarian  Assistance and Disaster Response</a> (HADR), and it leads the Search, Rescue and  Retrieval Cluster of the <a href="http://www.ndrrmc.gov.ph/">National Disaster Risk Reduction and  Management Council</a> (NDRRMC). It also provides manpower and logistics and communications  support to other government cluster agencies.

<h3>Institutionalizing the  CMCoord framework</h3>
                <p>In 2014, an <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/dialoguing.org/file/d/0B7ptUi-k6twmd1poY1AzcEsyZlk/edit">After-Action Review</a> (AAR) looked at the effectiveness of coordination  among humanitarian organizations, the military and police, and how foreign  military assets were tasked to support national and local authorities during  the Haiyan response. The AAR resulted in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/dialoguing.org/file/d/0B7ptUi-k6twmVnR2RWcxNU1GTGc/edit?pref=2&pli=1">a recommendation</a> to build capacity through training and  <a href="https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/operations/philippines/infographic/philippines-humanitarian-civil-military-coordination-infographic" target="_blank">institutionalizing humanitarian civil-military coordination</a>.</p>
                <p>With  this in mind, OCHA and the <a href="http://www.ocd.gov.ph/">Office of Civil Defense</a> (OCD) are conducting a series of  CMCoord trainings for the NDRRMC agencies to help build an understanding of the  cluster system and how humanitarian civil-military coordination fits into  existing disaster response arrangements with or without the involvement of  international actors.</p>
              <p>Ola Almgren, Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator, says  these efforts are, &ldquo;aimed at developing trainers and practitioners from the  military and government who can be deployed within the country and coordinate  civil-military activities when needed.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Over  300 members of the military, police, other Government agencies and the Humanitarian  Country Team (HCT) have been trained so far. OCHA Philippines partners with AFP  and OCD to conduct the pilot training for military field commanders under the  AFP <a href="http://www.afp.mil.ph/index.php/links/2013-07-30-03-32-44/unified-commands">Unified Commands</a>. These are the units mandated to  conduct immediate HADR operations in their areas of responsibility and to  support other affected areas as needed. Similar training was conducted in June  2016 for senior officers of the General Headquarters and <a href="http://www.army.mil.ph/">Army</a>, <a href="http://navy.mil.ph/">Navy</a> and <a href="http://www.paf.mil.ph/">Air  Force</a> branches.</p>
Addressing the officers attending the recent training workshop, Almgren  assured that, &ldquo;OCHA Philippines will continue to support the Government to  ensure it is always at the forefront of disaster response.&rdquo;
                
                <h3>Regional Consultative Group  on CMCoord</h3>
                <p>The Philippines, represented  by OCD Administrator Undersecretary Alexander Pama, was elected in 2015 as the  first chair of the <a href="https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/ROAP/Civil%20Military%20Coordination/docs/RCG_First%20Session_Summary_Report_Final.pdf">Regional Consultative Group (RCG) on  Humanitarian Civil-Military Coordination</a>. The RCG will facilitate the coordination of operational planning  between civilian and military entities preparing to respond to major disasters  in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The  Philippines is honoured to be the first chair of the RCG,&rdquo; says Pama, &ldquo;and we  wish to share our experiences on disaster management, particularly in receiving  international humanitarian assistance and foreign military assets.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>                  As  chair, Pama monitors the work plans of countries highly vulnerable to  large-scale natural disasters like Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal and the  Philippines. The chair also advocates streamlining civil-military coordination  exercises and including civil society organizations and the private sector. </p>
                <p> For  its own work plan, the Philippines will integrate the CMCoord concept into  existing disaster preparedness policy and guidelines. It also wants to leverage  the Philippines International Humanitarian Assistance Cluster of the NDRRMC to strengthen coordination and improve  situational awareness. &ldquo;We have a wealth of lessons learned and good practices  which the international community can draw upon to help improve disaster risk  reduction policies,&rdquo; Pama said.</p>
The Philippines is also part of an <a href="https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/ROAP/Civil%20Military%20Coordination/docs/160408%20Common%20Standards%20Advisory%20Group%20ToR%20(Final).pdf">advisory group</a> developing common humanitarian CMCoord standards to enhance the  predictability, effectiveness, efficiency, and coherence of employing military  assets, and maintain a distinction in the roles and responsibilities between  the humanitarian and military responders.

              <h2>Rapid humanitarian response  in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao</h2>
              <h3><strong>Above-normal rainfall and  strong typhoons expected in late 2016</strong></h3>
                <p>The Autonomous Region in  Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), comprising the provinces of Maguidanao, Lanao del Sur,  Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, has long experienced sporadic armed conflict that  causes displacement and suffering of already impoverished people in the region.  AFP frequently engages in law enforcement operations against militant groups like  the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters in Maguidanao, the Maute group in Lanao  del Sur and the Abu Sayyaf in Basilan and Sulu. Long-standing feuds between  armed groups and families, known locally as <em>rido, </em>have also caused repeated displacements in central Mindanao.</p>

              </div></p>
<p>Added  to this, recurring natural hazards, such as flooding along marshlands,  watersheds and low-lying areas also affect communities on yearly basis. This  past year, the ARMM provinces were among the worst affected by drought caused  by El Niño. These frequent and recurring events have drained the meagre calamity  funds of local governments, degrading their capacity to respond to further  disasters this year.</p>
<p>In 2013, ARMM established the Humanitarian Emergency Action and Response  Team (ARMM-HEART) to augment the humanitarian assistance of local governments  in the region to people affected by armed conflicts and natural disasters. ARMM-HEART  works in partnership with the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management  Council. It created an operation centre that brings together regional offices  of the national government and aid agencies to carry out rapid assessments and  provide basic relief items. The Cotabato-based operation centre also  coordinates the work of the Regional Human Rights Commission, the Philippine  National Police, AFP, OCD and other stakeholders in partnership with the local  authorities to respond rapidly to save lives.</p>
<p>Ramil  Masukat, the director of ARMM-HEART, says, &ldquo;We conduct training on basic rescue  and other things that build the capacities of the barangay officers and  municipal disaster risk reduction and management officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  ARMM-HEART  also has its challenges in responding to conflict and natural disasters. Coordination  among the different levels of local government with the ARMM government remains  an issue. In Marawi City in Lanao del Sur, the organization is working to  strengthen the coordination between the provincial and municipal authorities  and other stakeholders to respond better to those affected by the conflict in the  municipality of Butig.</p>
<p> &ldquo;There  are many challenges,&rdquo; Masukat said, &ldquo;but most of the time we face the limited  resources of the local governments, so sometimes ARMM-HEART acts to cover most  of the relief assistance to the [affected people] during disaster operations.&rdquo; <br>
  Security  is another concern. &ldquo;It is always a challenge to respond quickly due to  security concerns of the staff,&rdquo; he said.
  </p>
<p>This year, ARMM is implementing a Humanitarian and Development Action  Plan (HDAP) with funding from the national government to address the mid- to  long-term needs of people affected by conflict and natural disasters. It  involves constructing roads and bridges, providing farm animals and equipment,  training women and out-of-school youth, building the capacity of local  volunteers and rehabilitating health facilities. HDAP is expected to improve  not only the immediate response to disasters but provide livelihood support to  enable communities to recover from repeated shocks. </p>

              <h2>The Philippines&rsquo; unique  history of embracing refugees</h2>
              <p>On 20 June, we recognized the 16th annual <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/refugeeday/">World Refugee Day</a>. The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refugeeday/">UN Refugee Agency</a> marked the event by launching  its #WithRefugees petition to tell governments they must work together and do  their share for <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/refugeeday/background.shtml">refugees</a>.</p>
        <p>Since  the early 20th century, the Philippines has welcomed multitudes of refugees  from around the world when other nations would not, and has actively engaged to  resettle them. <a href="http://unhcr.ph/">UNHCR Representative in the Philippines</a>, Bernard Kerblat, extensively researched the history of asylum seekers  in the Philippines, grouping them into nine waves. </p>
        
              <h3>Welcoming refugees from abroad</h3>
              <p>The first group to seek refuge in  the Philippines arrived in 1923 as part of a larger diaspora of &ldquo;White  Russians&rdquo; escaping the Communist Red Army. Most of the 800 exiles were subsequently transferred to  the United States (US), but some chose to remain.</p>
              <p> Conflicts  resulting from the spread of fascism, communism and imperialism across Europe and  Asia that would peak as World War II spawned the next six waves of refugees. The  second wave came between 1934 and 1941, when over 1,200 European Jews were  settled in the country. The Government, <a href="http://www.gov.ph/1939/02/15/statement-president-quezon-on-jewish-settlement-in-mindanao-february-15-1939/">determined to do its share</a>, planned to resettle up to 10,000  Jewish refugees in Mindanao, but the plan never materialized.</p>
              <p> At  the same time, the third wave comprising thousands of Spanish Republicans  fleeing civil war arrived. By 1940, the fourth wave of refugees, this time <a href="http://www.gov.ph/1937/08/21/proclamation-no-173-s-1937/">from China</a> and <a href="http://www.gov.ph/1940/07/01/proclamation-no-570-s-1940/"> the British colony of Hong Kong</a> was well on its way. That year the <a href="http://www.gov.ph/1940/08/26/commonwealth-act-no-613/">Philippine Immigration Act of 1940</a> was enacted limiting the annual number  of immigrants to 500 of any one nationality. It included, however, a provision allowing  the president &ldquo;to admit aliens who are refugees for religious, political or  racial reasons.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>                The latter half of the 20th  century would see significant increases in the number of refugees seeking  asylum in the Philippines. The fifth wave of more than 6,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/BQSl3ECgQrg">White Russians</a> arrived between 1949 and 1951 and settled near Guiuan, Eastern  Samar, making it one of the largest refugee camps in Philippine history. The  conflicts in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos brought successive waves of refugees. From  1975 to 1992 about 400,000 Indochinese refugees passed through processing  centres in Palawan and Bataan. A thriving community of nearly 3,000 Vietnamese  remains in Palawan.</p>
              <p> In between, the 1979 Iranian Revolution led several thousand  Iranians studying in the Philippines to seek refugee status due to the regime  change in their country. By the early 1990s, Iranians formed the majority of  non-Indochinese refugees in the country.</p>
              <p>Finally, the ninth wave saw  some 600 people from East Timor flee to the Philippines in 2000 to escape the  violence of its war of independence from Indonesia. The refugees were  repatriated after security was restored. Most recently, the Government said it  is open to sheltering Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.</p>
              <h3>The Philippines&rsquo; commitment to protect the  rights of all refugees </h3>
              <p>In spite of the Philippines&rsquo; rich history welcoming  refugees, it struggles with the recurrent displacement of its own people by  conflict and natural disasters. In 2015, UNHCR recorded over 400,000 people in  Mindanao forced to flee, with one in ten of those repeatedly displaced, mostly  by conflict, <em>rido</em> or generalized  violence. It has yet to pass a <a href="https://www.senate.gov.ph/lisdata/2148718237!.pdf">law</a> on the rights of its own  populations displaced internally by conflict and natural disasters. A 2013 bill  was vetoed by the president, and a 2015 iteration was never voted on and will  need to be re-filed when the new Congress convenes in July.</p>
              <p> At the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, Turkey, in  May, <a href="http://www.dswd.gov.ph/2016/05/ph-shares-disaster-management-experience-in-1-st-world-humanitarian-summit-in-turkey/">Department of Social  Welfare and Development</a> Secretary Corazon Soliman <a href="http://webtv.un.org/watch/corazon-soliman-philippines-world-humanitarian-summit-istanbul-2016-member-states-and-stakeholders-announcements/4907734504001">announced</a> the Philippines&rsquo;  commitments to the five <a href="http://www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/core-responsibilities-foundation-world-humanitarian-summit">Core Responsibilities</a> of the UN&rsquo;s <a href="http://sgreport.worldhumanitariansummit.org/">Agenda for Humanity</a>, including &ldquo;to uphold  international laws and norms on human rights, armed conflict and refugees&rdquo; and  to work on the passage of the IDP bill.  </p>

              <h3>HCT joins National  Earthquake Drill</h3>
              <p>HCT was invited for the  first time to participate in the quarterly National Simultaneous Earthquake  Drill, which took place on 22 June at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City, which  simulated a 7.2 magnitude earthquake striking metro Manila—a catastrophic event  that would likely require an international humanitarian response. NDRRMC and  HCT exercised their processes for requesting and coordinating international  resources.</p><p><div class=img-holder>
