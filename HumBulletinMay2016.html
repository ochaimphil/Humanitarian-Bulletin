              <h2>Local NGOs respond to emergencies and build community  resilience in Mindanao</h2>
              <h3><strong>Humanitarians at home in coalition</strong></h3>
                <p>Local NGOs and  civil society organizations (CSOs), as part of their own communities, work to  reduce poverty and drive sustainable development. When disasters or conflict  strike, they are the first to respond with relief assistance and stay to  support recovery and build community resilience long after other organizations  have left. </p>
                
Mindanao is home to  diverse groups of Muslims, Christians and indigenous peoples who suffer  recurrent displacement due to tropical cyclones, seasonal flooding and armed  clashes. Here, local organizations have engaged in an array of programmes  encompassing humanitarian response, development assistance and peacebuilding. The <a href="http://mincode.org/">Mindanao Coalition of  Development NGO Networks (MINCODE)</a> is one of  the largest NGO coalitions in the Philippines composed of 11 CSO networks with  some 700 organizations, a few of which will be introduced below.

              <h3>Building flood resilience  in indigenous villages of Agusan Marsh</h3>
              <p>The <a href="http://phildhrra.net">Philippine  Partnership for the Development of Human Resources in Rural Areas (PhilDHRRA)</a> is a network of 52 NGOs that run agrarian  reform and rural development programmes across the country. PhilDHRRA&rsquo;s  Mindanao chapter recently completed a three-year disaster preparedness project that  covered eight municipalities in Agusan del Sur province.               
<p>Monobo tribes form the majority of indigenous  people who reside in the Agusan Marsh, which floods annually between November  and February. The communities rely on fishing during the wet season and farming  rice and vegetables during the drier months. They have also adapted to living  in floating villages, complete with schools, daycare centres and health  stations, and using pump boats for transportation.</p>
Increasingly severe  flooding in recent years has forced the Manobos to elevate their homes and  infrastructure. Disaster risk reduction and preparedness have become their  priorities, according to Glenn Bais, Mindanao Regional Coordinator of  PhilDHRRA. The group provided these communities with pump boats, a spiral tube  water wheel for power-free irrigation, and flood- and pest-resistant rice seeds.  It also set up a seed bank to maintain local seed availability and diversity.

<h3>Delivering humanitarian aid  in conflict-affected Lanao del Sur and Basilan</h3>
                <p>The <a href="http://maradeca.org/">Maranao People Development Center (MARADECA), Inc.</a> is a local NGO with 200 staff operating in  Lanao del Sur, one of the poorest and the most conflict-prone provinces in  Mindanao. When fighting broke out in the municipality of Butig in February  between government forces and local armed insurgents and uprooted as many as  40,000 people, MARADECA staff helped the displaced residents flee to safer  grounds. They conducted priority needs assessments which informed subsequent relief  assistance. Despite the volatile security situation, they continued to  implement peacebuilding, education and microfinancing projects to help the  returning residents get back on their feet.</p>
                <p>Farida,  the NGO&rsquo;s Peace and Development Coordinator, said she is happy to assist the grassroots  peacebuilding initiatives because &ldquo;I feel fulfilled and I see myself growing in  the work that contributes directly to the improvement of the community.&rdquo; At age  27, she takes pride in mediating community disputes and taking part in  provincial meetings to advance political dialogue.</p>
                <p>Another NGO, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IRDT-419876564726772/">Integrated  Resource Development for Tri-People (IRDT)</a>,  operates out of Zamboanga City. IRDT&rsquo;s 73 staff members work primarily in the  provinces of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. In Basilan, intermittent clashes  between government forces and the Abu Sayyaf Group frequently displace the  local population. Working in partnership with UN agencies and International  NGOs, whose staff have limited access to these provinces due to security  concerns, IRDT and other local NGOs have risked kidnapping and firearm  encounters to reach displaced people with relief items and health services.</p>

                <h3>Will the Grand Bargain do  justice to the long-advocated localization of aid?</h3>
                <p>In spite of funding  shortages and security risks, local organizations like PhilDHRRA, MARADECA and  IRDT continue to foster community-based projects that find local  solutions to complex challenges in Mindanao. They often find  themselves operating in the shadow of larger aid organizations, and are at times frustrated at having to prove they are capable of serving their own people.  &ldquo;International agencies do not always trust the capacity and expertise of local  NGOs. This can delay response in the wake of disasters,&rdquo; said one NGO&rsquo;s field  officer. Yet their work is well recognized by local governments and, most  importantly, by the people they serve. </p>
Less than two per cent of  global humanitarian funding currently goes directly to national NGOs and CSOs,  even though it is widely acknowledged that aid delivered by local agencies is  often faster, cheaper and more culturally appropriate. The first-ever <a href="https://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org">World Humanitarian Summit</a> convened by the UN Secretary-General on 23 and  24 May in Istanbul, Turkey, tackled localization of aid among other pressing  humanitarian concerns of the world today. At the summit, donors and  humanitarian partners agreed to a &ldquo;Grand Bargain&rdquo; for smarter humanitarian  financing, which included a commitment to channelling &ldquo;25 per cent of funding  to national and local responders as directly as possible by 2020&rdquo;. This must  now be followed by tangible steps to empower local organizations and help them implement  humanitarian and developing programmes with greater impact, community relevance  and sustainability.

              <h2>Preparing for the new rainy season</h2>
              <h3><strong>Above-normal rainfall and  strong typhoons expected in late 2016</strong></h3>
                <p>On  24 May, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services  Administration (PAGASA) declared the onset of the rainy season associated with  the southwest monsoon. The monsoon, along with the Intertropical Convergence  Zone and low pressure areas (some of which will develop into tropical cyclones),  will bring rains to the Philippines from late May to October. Meanwhile, dry conditions  are expected to persist in parts of Mindanao and the western Philippines until  July as El Ni√±o weakens.</p>
              <p><div class="img-holder">
                <img src="assets/images/hbMay16_Hazards pie chart.png" style="width:60%">
                <div class="caption"></div>
              </div></p>
<p>PAGASA  forecasts between 8 and 17 tropical cyclones to develop in or enter the  Philippine Area of Responsibility during the coming five months, while stronger  typhoons are expected in the last quarter of the year. The country is affected  by an average of 20 tropical cyclones annually.</p>
<p>The  state weather bureau also warned of an anticipated La Ni√±a phenomenon, which  will begin developing in August with its effects peaking between November 2016 and  February 2017. La Ni√±a will likely bring above-normal rainfall and thus  increase the potential for floods and landslides, particularly in the eastern parts  of the country.</p>
<div>
  <div> </div>
</div>
                <h3><strong>Tropical cyclones pose the  highest disaster risk to the Philippines </strong></h3>
                <p>Since 2011, the Philippines has consistently ranked as the  world&rsquo;s second or third most disaster-prone country in the <a href="http://www.worldriskreport.org/">World Risk Report</a>. This is mainly  due to the country&rsquo;s high exposure to natural hazards.</p>
Tropical cyclones were the leading cause of natural disasters in the Philippines  between 1980 and 2015, according to the <a href="http://www.emdat.be/">EM-DAT  International Disaster Database</a> of the Centre for Research on the  Epidemiology of Disasters. This was followed by floods, drought, earthquakes  and volcanic activities. The highest number of disaster victims was recorded in  2013 due to Super Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) that devastated the  Visayas in November and a mangnitude-7.2 earthquake in Bohol in October.
              <p><div class="img-holder" style="width:100%">
                <img id="disasterregion" src="assets/images/hbMay_Hazards by region year.png">
                <div class="caption"></div>
              </div></p>
                         
              <p>Between 2010 and 2014, Central Luzon (Region III) was home to both the highest  numbers of hydro-meteorological incidents and of people cumulatively affected  by these incidents, according to the Office of Civil Defense. Typhoon-related  incidents were more common in Luzon (Regions II, III, V and the Cordillera  Administrative Region) while Mindanao regions suffered seasonal flooding.</p>
<p>The concentration of the people affected by  hydro-meteorological disasters among the total population was the highest in  regions along the eastern seaboard of the country hit by strong tropical storms  and typhoons. Spikes  in Figure 2 generally correspond to the occurrences of strong tropical cyclones  that affected these regions e.g. Typhoons Nesat (Pedring) and Nalgae (Quiel) in  2011, Typhoon Bopha (Pablo) in 2012, Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, and Typhoon  Hagupit (Ruby) in 2014.</p>

<h3><strong>Humanitarian partners gear  up emergency response preparedness</strong></h3>
                <p>The year 2015 saw  an increased capacity of the Philippine government to manage disaster response  and relief operations, to which international aid agencies provided targeted  support with local capacity and in-country resources. Ahead of the 2016 rainy  season, the Philippines Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) ‚Äì composed of UN  agencies, NGOs and the Red Cross movements ‚Äì has worked to further strengthen  the national response preparedness in the areas of civil-military coordination,  data preparedness, sectoral response planning and operational capacity  building. At the same time, HCT is readying itself for the next disaster to be  able to complement the government-led response with speed and at an appropriate  scale. </p>
                <div>
                  <p>International humanitarian partners build      national response capacity while advancing their own response preparedness      for the next disaster. </p>
                </div>
As  part of the continuous roll-out of <a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/system/files/emergency_response_preparedness_2015_final.pdf">IASC&rsquo;s Emergency  Response Preparedness (ERP)</a> guidance in the Philippines, HCT&rsquo;s Emergency  Response Preparedness Working Group held a contingency planning workshop on 5  May with the cluster coordinators and the emergency relief focal points of aid  agencies and private sector partners. The  workshop informed a subsequent extended meeting of HCT, which agreed on priority  actions: continuous engagement with the Government to establish common tools  and procedures for needs assessment; development of a document outlining HCT&rsquo;s  readiness to support the government-led coordination structure; enhanced cluster  preparedness and institutionalization of recovery planning across clusters; creation  of an HCT business continuity plan; and more strategic resource mobilization for  emergency response.
