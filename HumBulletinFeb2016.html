              <h2>Drought hits Zamboanga IDPs</h2>
              <h3>Water rationing tightened  amid persisting drought in Zamboanga City</h3>
                <p>The  Zamboanga City Water District tightened its water rationing schedule on 27  January due to an alarming drop in the water inflow at Tumaga river reservoir –  the city&rsquo;s main water source. Daily distribution of water has since been cut  down to 8 hours from the previous 12 hours. </p>
The citywide water shortage  is also affecting about 16,100 internally displaced people (IDPs) who are  staying in 12 transition sites across Zamboanga City. They have been waiting  for permanent homes for almost two and half years since they were uprooted by  the September 2013 fighting between government forces and a faction of the Moro  National Liberation Front. In addition, an estimated 7,700 &ldquo;home-based&rdquo; IDPs  are staying with relatives and friends or renting temporary homes

              <h3>Water shortage takes a toll  on the most vulnerable among the IDPs</h3>
              <p>Midzfar Pulalon lives in Mampang  transition site – the largest IDP site located in the outskirts of Zamboanga City.  Now 34 years old, he was disabled by polio at an early age. Midzfar used to  live in Rio Hondo, a coastal area near the city centre where he sold cell  phones for a living, until he lost both his home and income to the September  2013 fighting. 
       <p>         The city&rsquo;s daily water  rations do not cover the needs of over 7,600 IDPs in Mampang transition site.  Even with his disability, Midzfar endured waiting in line for the delivery of  water. However, with less water available at the site now, he has resorted to  buying water from the host community. With the little money sent from his  sister who works abroad, Midzfar pays PhP25 (US$.50) a day to buy 100 litres of  water needed for his family. The price of water may rise as growing demand  outstrips supply. He fears that he might not be able to afford water throughout  the drought which is predicted to last until June.</p>
<p>The  City Water District is mobilising four water trucks to supply water to all transition  sites. It is planning to procure additional trucks but they are not likely to  arrive before April. To address the gap, the Philippine Red Cross will provide  additional water tanker truck to augment the city&rsquo;s water distribution to the  IDPs until May. Meanwhile, other humanitarian agencies on the ground including  CFSI, FAO, ILO, IOM and UNHCR continue to support the authorities with  providing camp management, protection, civil documentation, livelihood and  community engagement assistance to the IDPs.</p>

<h3>Impacts of El Niño on food  security and health</h3>
                <p>While the prevailing El Niño has affected large areas of the Philippines, the most severe  damage to agriculture is concentrated in Mindanao. About half of the total 194,000  hectares of affected farm areas are in Mindanao, 87 per cent of which have no  chance of recovery.</p>
<p>In Zamboanga City alone,  agricultural losses attributed to El Niño rose to almost PhP17.7 million ($373,000)  as of 5 February, affecting over 900 farmers with 860 hectares of agricultural  lands, the vast majority of which (780 hectares) have no chance of recovery, according  to the Office of the City Agriculturist. As the drought persists, the City  Agriculturalist predicts that up to 30 per cent or 3,500 hectares of the city&rsquo;s  rice fields may be lost in the coming months. To mitigate the situation, the authorities  are providing affected farmers with a rice variety that can grow in saline or  dry conditions and instructing them to adopt quick-turnaround planting of  vegetables.</p>
<p>The  City Health Office is concerned that water shortages may raise the risks of diarrhoea  and other waterborne diseases among children and other vulnerable groups. From December  2015 to January 2016, six IDPs reportedly died, bringing up the total deaths among  the IDPs since the September 2013 conflict to 293.</p>
<p>Alerted  by the mounting impact of El Niño on food  security and health of the IDPs, the city authorities will conduct a rapid nutrition survey in all transition  sites to monitor and address malnutrition. They will also resume food distribution  to all transition sites from March for 11 months, accompanied by provision of kitchen  sets and cash assistance.</p>
<p>However,  temporary assistance to address the immediate needs of the IDPs alone cannot  provide durable solutions to their displacement. As of mid-February, just over  2,000 out of the planned 6,500 permanent housing units under the government&rsquo;s  Zamboanga Recovery, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation (Z3R) were completed. With  an increasing delay in the Z3R implementation timeline, aid agencies fear that  most of the remaining IDPs may be left in limbo into the third year of  displacement.</p>

              <h2>Renewed violence, renewed displacement</h2>
              <h3><strong>Armed clashes in central Mindanao displace over 56,000 people</strong></h3>
                <p>Successive  clashes between the Government forces and armed groups in Maguindanao province  have displaced over 5,000 families (25,000 people) as of 25 February, according  to the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in the Autonomous Region in Muslim  Mindanao (ARMM). Fighting began on 5 February in the municipality of Datu  Salibo and spread to the neighbouring Datu Saudi Ampatuan and Sharif Aguak  municipalities. The majority (4,300 families or 21,500 people) of the displaced  people are staying in nine evacuation sites in these municipalities while the  rest are staying with relatives and friends. Five civilians were wounded  including a boy and a girl.</p>
<p>On  21 February, another round of firefights erupted between the military and an armed  group in Butig municipality of Lanao del Sur province. Continuous fighting  displaced an estimated 6,200 families (31,200 people) as of 29 February.</p><p>Local  authorities at the regional, provincial and municipal levels provided food  packs and established emergency health clinics for the displaced people in the  two provinces. The Mindanao Humanitarian Team, comprised of UN agencies, Red  Cross and international and local NGOs operating in the area, is liaising with  the authorities to monitor the situation closely. ICRC issued a <a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/philippines-fighting-causes-new-displacements-mindanao">news release</a> calling on all parties to the conflict to  strictly abide by international humanitarian law. The security situation in the  affected municipalities remains volatile and may prolong displacement.

                <h3><strong>Conflict-induced displacement more than doubles in Mindanao in 2015</strong></h3>
                <p>Almost  407,400 people were cumulatively displaced in Mindanao in 2015, including some 37,000 who were repeatedly forced to flee their homes mostly because of  armed conflict, clan wars and other forms of violence, a <a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/philippines-displacement-dashboard-mindanao-forced-displacement-annual-report">new report</a> of UNHCR and the Philippines Protection Cluster  revealed.</p>
                <p>Conflict-related  displacement increased by 127 per cent compared to 2014. This was largely  driven by the Government&rsquo;s joint military operations against the Bangsamoro  Islamic Freedom Fighters which intensified from February to March 2015. At its  peak more than 148,000 people were displaced in Maguindanao province alone.  Central Mindanao including Maguindanao was home to the vast majority (over 80  per cent) of over 231,600 conflict-induced IDPs in 2015, followed by North  Cotabato and Basilan provinces.</p>
              <p>Natural hazards such as flooding and heavy rains  displaced over 119,400 people, three quarters of whom in North Cotabato and  Sultan Kudarat provinces which are adjacent to Maguindanao. The report  highlighted that many people in central Mindanao who suffer annual flooding are  also subject to frequent displacement due to conflict. </p>
With persisting insecurity,  long-term recovery and development assistance to help the returning IDPs has  been limited. &ldquo;To date, durable solutions for these displaced people continue  to be a pressing concern especially in an environment where peace and order  remains to be elusive&rdquo;, the report concluded.

              <h2>Disability and age in  humanitarian context</h2>
              <h3>Addressing unique needs of  vulnerable groups in emergencies</h3>
              <p>Sudden onset emergencies  often affect an entire community of people without discrimination, but the ways  in which different people are affected and their needs in humanitarian response  vary significantly. Vulnerable groups including children, women, the elderly  and persons with disabilities are often put under increased physical,  psychological and emotional pressure by natural disasters and conflicts, which  expose them to greater vulnerability and dependence on others. </p>
        <p><a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/world/disability-humanitarian-context-views-affected-people-and-field-organisations">A 2015  study by Handicap International</a> brought to light key challenges and gaps in humanitarian response for persons  with disabilities. The majority of persons with disabilities who participated  in the survey experienced direct physical impact during disasters and conflicts,  which at times caused new impairments. Up to 80 per cent of them noted the lack  of access to basic needs including shelter, food, water and health services in the  aftermath. The lack of information about available assistance was identified as  a key barrier. The vast majority of humanitarian actors recognised increased vulnerability  of persons with disabilities in times of crisis but felt that it was not taken into  account properly in response.</p>
              <p>In  the Philippines, a community survey conducted by HelpAge International and the Coalition  of Services of the Elderly (COSE) following Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as  Yolanda), which devastated the Visayas in November 2013, found that the elderly  among the affected often faced financial and physical challenges in accessing  basic services including medical care. Those who suffered physical trauma during  the typhoon and live in remote, mountainous villages were unable to reach healthcare  facilities. Many could not afford medication and did not know how or where to seek  help. Based on these findings, HelpAge and COSE in partnership with local authorities  and healthcare providers set up mobile healthcare services</a> in Leyte and Cebu, with which registered nurses now visit  the affected elderly for regular medical check-ups.</p>

<h3>Mainstreaming elderly- and  disability-inclusive humanitarian response</h3>
              <p>In the second half  of 2015, the inter-agency Community of Practice (CoP) on Community Engagement  in the Philippines initiated pilot training on humanitarian communication with  the elderly and persons with disabilities. Handicap International and HelpAge facilitated  workshops for some 20 organisations including UN agencies, INGOs, local civil  society organizations, the government&rsquo;s information bureau and the media. The  training stressed the importance of an inclusive approach to engaging the  vulnerable groups in emergency preparedness and response. It also discussed how  modern communication technology such as speech-sensitive  communication applications in mobile phones and laptops could help address the unique needs of these  groups. The CoP aims to continually enhance in-country capacity and resources to  address humanitarian needs of these vulnerable groups as part of overall  humanitarian programming.</p>

              <h3>First legislation in Asia  to protect children in emergencies</h3>
              <p>Landmark <a href="https://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=16&q=SBN-3034">legislation</a> to protect fundamental rights of children affected by disasters and  other emergencies was approved by the Philippine Congress on 2 February. The  bill, the Children's Emergency Relief and Protection Act, mandates the  Government to establish a comprehensive emergency programme to enhance the  provision of life-saving humanitarian and protection assistance to children,  ensure their access to education and civil documentation, and train emergency  responders on child protection. Save the Children, UNICEF and other  international and local aid agencies supported the concerned lawmakers and  government agencies in the drafting and advocacy of the bill, which drew upon <a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/after-yolanda-what-children-think-need-and-recommend">lessons of the responses to Typhoon  Haiyan</a> and other past disasters  that affected the Philippines.</p>
