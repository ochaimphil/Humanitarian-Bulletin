              <h2>Sarangani farmers go hungry in drought</h2>
              <h3><strong>El Niño brings drought to 40 per cent of the Philippines</strong></h3>
                <p>Now we seldom eat rice or bread, [and when  we do] it&rsquo;s mostly with just vegetables,&rdquo; says farmer Jennie Korbo, while  surveying the cracked, parched soil of what used to be a corn field in  Sarangani province, Mindanao.</p>
              <p>While  the Philippines is in the midst of election fever, farmers in the south are  suffering from El Niño-induced heat that is laying waste to normally productive  land.</p>
              <div class="img-holder"> <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/PHL-OCHA-Coping-With-El_Nino-Infographic-29042016.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/PHL-OCHA-Coping-With-ElNino-Infographic-29042016-.png"></a>

              </div>
              <p>Jennie has lost her two last corn crops  and is now in serious debt because of the drought. The ribs of her two cows are  clearly visible as they amble from tree to tree seeking shelter from the  unrelenting sun. &ldquo;I just give them water so that they feel full. They only eat  the dried corn stubs from the field,&rdquo; she says.</p>
              <p> The provincial capital of Alabel in  Sarangani is full of farmers like Jennie who depend on corn for their  livelihood. The municipality declared a state of calamity in 2015 when the region  began to feel the full impact of El Niño. </p>
Now  with an estimated 40 per cent of the country suffering drought, 11 provinces, 10  cities and 26 municipalities and barangays across the country - but mostly in  Mindanao – have declared states of calamity. Some 182,000 farmers with 224,800  hectares of agricultural land have been affected by El Niño.

              </div>
              <h3>Local authorities struggle  to respond quickly due to funding freeze</h3>
              <p>In Alabel, an estimated 5,500 hectares of  land normally supporting corn – including Jennie&rsquo;s 1.8-ha rented farmland – lie  unplanted since February due to the lack of water. About 500 hectares of banana  plantation are also affected, municipal agriculturist Enriguito Dagupto  estimates.<br>
According to Dagupto, many of the farmers  say their families are close to starvation and are waiting anxiously for  assistance from the Government. &ldquo;The national government has promised  irrigation pumps and seeds but as of now they have not been delivered. The  Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) is also promising food and  clothing,&rdquo; says Dagupto.              
              <p> The  farmers&rsquo; problems are compounded by the fact that government assistance has to  follow special procedures for the 45 days in the lead up to the national and  local elections in May. The municipality&rsquo;s emergency funds are far from  sufficient to help all those in need. &ldquo;We have PhP3 million (US$64,000) in the calamity  fund but are allowed to use only half of it [for this drought],&rdquo; Dagupto says. The  rest is saved for future possible calamities.              
              <p> Although Sarangani province  is among the poorest in the Philippines, its fertile land provides corn, rice,  banana, coconut, vegetables and fruits for the rest of the country.  Since February the region has lost half of  its high-value crops, according to estimates.               
                The national weather bureau  forecasts that dry conditions in parts of Mindanao may last until July. The local  officials say they can only pray for the rain to come earlier. &ldquo;We are getting  worried that if assistance does not arrive in time, our people will really  suffer. There may be massive hunger and peace and order will be affected,&rdquo; says  Dagupto.
              <h3>Farmers cope with hardships  as they await assistance</h3>
                <p>The  Government has released $98 million to help counter the impact of El Niño on  agriculture, through providing seeds, fertilisers, water pumps and technical  training to the affected farmers and cloud seeding and other water supply  augmentation. In addition, $11 million has been made available for emergency  employment assistance and another $2 million for food distribution to the  affected households. Unfortunately, none has arrived to help Jennie so far.</p>
                <p>UN agencies, the Red Cross, and international and national  NGOs are supporting the  authorities with emergency food security assessment, distribution of food,  water and other relief items, and financial and technical assistance to the  affected farming communities especially in Mindanao.</p>
              <p>While the scorching El Niño  heat continues, Jennie slips deeper into debt. She borrowed PhP30,000 ($650)  for seeds and fertilizer last August. &ldquo;Before, we got 250 sacks of corn from my  land; the last time I only harvested 20 sacks.&rdquo; In February this year she did  not plant at all. </p>
                <p> Normally Jennie would earn  PhP20,000 ($430) per harvest. Now she can&rsquo;t pay back her loan with its steep 10  per cent monthly interest rate. Plus she needs money to pay the rent on her  farmland and food for the family. The solution is to eat less, earn a few extra  dollars from ad-hoc jobs and borrow more. <br>
                  Jennie&rsquo;s family is  consuming bananas as an alternative to their staple food of rice. Her eldest  son had to drop out of school to take a job as a motorcycle driver, while other  siblings earned small fees for setting up an instant photography service at  local end-of-school-year ceremonies.</p>
These, however, are not  sustainable means to make the family&rsquo;s ends meet, and Jennie is worried about  the decreasing water level in her hand-pumped tube well. If the family runs out  of potable water, she may have to borrow again, from whomever she can, even  though she will probably spiral downward into debt which may take a long time  to repay, even after the weather improves.

              <h2>Zamboanga: Drought hits IDPs and farmers</h2>
              <h3><strong>Displaced families in  Mampang suffer water shortages</strong></h3>
                <p>In January,  when the water level at the city&rsquo;s main reservoir dropped to a critical level,  Zamboanga City began rationing water. Water has been delivered only on  alternate days to the Mampang-1 transition site since the end of March, leaving  some 4,400 displaced people in the position of competing for water they need. Those  who could afford to buy water have resorted to doing so. The city water  district has a limited number of water trucks, which struggle to deliver water  to all areas in the city including 12 transition sites.</p>
Some 23,000 people remain displaced from the fighting that broke out  between the military and a faction of the Moro National Liberation Front in  September 2013. About 15,300 of these internally displaced people (IDPs) are  staying in the transitional sites like Mampang, largely disconnected from  livelihood opportunities, while the rest have been hosted by relatives and  friends or are renting temporary homes.

                <h3><strong>Authorities to provide cash  and food assistance to drought-hit farmers</strong></h3>
                <p>The drought has also taken  a heavy toll on the city&rsquo;s farmers, who have suffered up to 75 per cent  production losses. Edgar Silvestre, who lives in Barangay Mercedes, which is  dubbed the &ldquo;rice bowl of Zamboanga City&rdquo;, is one of the farmers affected by the  severe drought. A portion of his two-hectare rice field has been idle since the  last harvest in January. His was able to  harvest only 100 bags of rice, a third of the normal production.</p>
              <p>Edgar planted bitter gourds in place of rice,  but even these have been affected by the heat and have not fully developed to  yield adequate income. With the mounting production losses, he can only pay  half of his loan. He hopes to recover his losses with the next harvest expected  in October. </p>
                <p> The DSWD has committed to providing 10 days of  cash-for-work assistance to 3,000 out of over 6,000 farmers in the city. The  selected farmers will clean up river banks, irrigation canals and dams, and  plant mangrove propagules.</p>
                <p> The challenge now is to find ways to provide  support to the remaining farmers. The city authorities plan to distribute sacks  of rice to these farmers, but this has been made difficult by a nationwide ban  on public procurement for new projects, which began in late March ahead of the elections.  </p>
              <p> The city&rsquo;s Legal Office is seeking an exemption  from the Commission on Elections to allow for the use of the city&rsquo;s calamity  funds to purchase rice for the drought-affected farmers. Meanwhile, the city&rsquo;s  Agricultural Office has lent six water pumps to the affected farmers. The provision  of additional seeds and fertilisers will commence after the drought.</p>
Humanitarian organisations continue to provide camp management, water,  sanitation and hygiene, livelihood and community engagement support to the  displaced families, while monitoring the food, nutrition and health needs of  the IDPs and drought-affected farmers.<div class="img-holder" style="width:90%">

              <h2>Philippines seeks international classification for its  search and rescue teams</h2>
              <h3><strong>INSARAG capacity assessment team visits the Philippines</strong></h3>
              <p>From 4 to 8 April, a  group of urban search and rescue (USAR) experts from Australia, China, Japan  and Singapore visited the Philippines to assess operational capacity of three  USAR teams in the country. The visit was part of the <a href="http://www.insarag.org/">International Search  and Rescue Advisory Group&rsquo;s (INSARAG)</a> scoping exercise to help build national USAR capacity  in the Philippines, which could meet international standards to deploy in  response to sudden onset disasters overseas.</p>
        <p>INSARAG, established in 1991, is a global network of over 800 countries  and organisations working together to facilitate coordination among various  international USAR teams. These teams make themselves available for deployment  to countries suffering earthquakes and other devastating events of structural  collapse.<br>
During the five-day mission, the INSARAG team met with officials of the  Philippine government&rsquo;s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council  (NDRRMC) and evaluated USAR capabilities of the Philippine Air Force, the  Philippine Army and the Emergency Rescue Unit Foundation (ERUF), a civilian  rescue and emergency medical team based in Cebu. </p>
        <p>For the Philippine  government, strengthening USAR capacity to respond to sudden onset emergencies  has been a key priority since Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda), which  devastated the country&rsquo;s Visayas regions in November 2013. The NDRRMC  established a national response cluster on Search, Rescue and Retrieval (SRR)  to institutionalise timely, systematic and effective SRR operations in  disaster-affected areas. The Cluster coordinates and deploys available search  and rescue teams from the Government, the civil society, the local private  sector and the international community.

<p><strong>Key recommendations: policy, training, regional engagement and funding</strong></p>
        <p>On the last day of  the visit, the INSARAG team drew up 20 recommendations to pave the way forward  in the Philippines&rsquo; pursuit of <a href="http://www.insarag.org/en/iec/iec-leftmenu.html">INSARAG External Classification</a> in the coming years. Based on the institutional and  operational assessment of the USAR capacity of the country, these  recommendations focused on policy and governance, training, regional engagement  and funding.</p>
        <p>Overall, the INSARAG team found the Philippines&rsquo; USAR teams to be highly  competent to respond to disasters within the country. Meanwhile, the Government  is yet to develop national guidelines for outgoing international relief  including SRR units. Standardisation of training modules and joint training to  ensure interoperability across all USAR teams, continuous engagement with  INSARAG&rsquo;s regional activities, and long-term budgeting to sustain an  internationally-certified USAR capability are also needed.</p>
        <p> The scoping mission team assured that the INSARAG was a community of  practice that continuously learns from its members and that it would welcome  the lessons and best practices of the Philippines. &ldquo;We will remain committed to  sustainable development of the USAR capability in the Philippines,&rdquo;  Undersecretary Alexander Pama, Administrator of the  Office of Civil Defense and the NDRRMC&rsquo;s Executive Director, told the mission during its debrief to NDRRMC  officials. The Philippines also agreed to host the INSARAG Asia-Pacific  Regional Earthquake Response Exercise in 2017.</p>
The assessment team agreed  to send a follow-up mission after a year to evaluate the progress of  recommendations. OCHA as the Secretariat of the INSARAG facilitated the mission,  and will continue to support to the Philippine government in its further  endeavour.

        <h2>Philippine businesses for disaster resilience</h2>
        <h3><strong>Private sector as the first responder and lasting  partner for recovery</strong></h3>
        <p>Local businesses are often  directly affected by natural disasters such as tropical cyclones and  earthquakes. Yet they are usually among the first responders to these  calamities; they also stay long after international and national aid agencies  leave to support the communities get back on their feet.</p>
        <p> When Typhoon Haiyan struck the central Philippines in  November 2013, local companies and foundations provided the disaster-affected  communities with emergency relief items and logistics and communication  services. They revived the markets through keeping affected employees on the payroll  and providing livelihood support to small business owners down the supply  chains. Many also supported the Government&rsquo;s rehabilitation plan to rebuild  houses, schools and community infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Globally, private donations from individuals and organisations  contributed over $210 million in response to the typhoon and were in fact the  largest funding source to cover over 25 per cent of the UN-led Typhoon Haiyan  Strategic Response Plan, according to OCHA&rsquo;s Financial Tracking Service.        </p>
        
        <h3><strong>Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation</strong></h3>
        <p>The <a href="http://pdrf.org/">Philippine Disaster  Resilience Foundation (PDRF)</a> was founded in 2009 in the aftermath of Tropical  Storm Ketsana (Ondoy) and Typhoon Parma (Pepeng) to mobilise the resources of  influential businesses in the country to support the Government&rsquo;s  reconstruction programme. It has since served as an umbrella organisation for  the private sector to coordinate disaster preparedness, response and recovery efforts. </p>
        <p>In the wake of Typhoon  Haiyan, PDRF joined coordination meetings of the international humanitarian  community to share information and align its response initiatives with those of  other partners. Many PDRF members also sponsored the Government&rsquo;s recovery  programmes. In February 2015, PDRF became an Observer to the Philippines Humanitarian  Country Team to represent the country&rsquo;s private sector at large.</p>
        <p>More  recently, PDRF has undertaken a number of disaster preparedness initiatives  including: business continuity planning (BCP) workshop and other emergency preparedness  training for small and medium enterprises; new partnerships with businesses,  local civil society organisations, academic institutions and the media to  strengthen coordination and technical collaboration; participation in  metro-wide and nationwide earthquake simulation exercises; and establishment of  a <a href="http://pdrf.org/what-we-do/OpsCenter">disaster operation centre</a> managed by local business partners.</p><p>

        <h3><strong>World Humanitarian Summit and Connecting Businesses  initiative</strong></h3>
        <p>The role of businesses in  providing innovative, cost-efficient and effective solutions to humanitarian  assistance will be a key topic to be discussed at the first-ever <a href="https://worldhumanitariansummit.org/">World Humanitarian Summit</a> which will take place from  23 to 24 May in Istanbul, Turkey. At the Summit, a <a href="http://worldhumanitariansummit.org/summit/specialsessions#business">special session</a> will be dedicated to  launch the &ldquo;Connecting Businesses&rdquo; initiative, which aims to transform business  engagement and public-private partnerships in disaster risk reduction,  emergency preparedness, response and recovery by increasing the scale and  effectiveness of business engagement in a coordinated manner.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We need to link  humanitarian help and development to ensure that devastated areas truly recover  and are not left destitute and desolate after international aid agencies pull  out,&rdquo; said Rene &ldquo;Butch&rdquo; Meily, President of PDRF, in his <a href="http://blog.worldhumanitariansummit.org/entries/private-sector-in-drr/">blog post</a> for the Summit. &ldquo;Disasters are becoming more  complex with long-lasting effects on a population and one indispensable actor  to restore a region to normalcy is the private sector.&rdquo;      </p>
