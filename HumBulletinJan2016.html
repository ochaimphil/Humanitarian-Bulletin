              <h2>Small-scale farmers bear the brunt of El Niño in southern Mindanao</h2>
              <h3>Breadbasket of Mindanao hit by prolonged dry spell</h3>
                <p>While  the rain brought by Typhoon Melor (known locally as Nona), Tropical Depression  Onyok and the northeast monsoon brought much-needed respite from the drying  effects of El Niño, large areas of the Philippines are expected to suffer  drought in the coming months. Small-scale farmers in southern Mindanao are  already suffering a big drop in crop production, and fear that El Niño might  push them further into debt.</p>
<p>Region  XII of the Philippines, composed of South Cotabato, North Cotabato, Sultan  Kudarat and Sarangani provinces, is considered to be the breadbasket of Mindanao.  Mindanao accounts for over 40 per cent of the country&rsquo;s food requirements and  contributes more than 30 per cent to the national food trade according to FAO.  Farmers here produce staple crops including rice and corn and cultivate large  plantations of cash crops such as bananas and pineapples. </p>
<p>The prevailing El Niño has led  to dry conditions in 2015. Sarangani province in particular recorded below-normal  (40-80 per cent of average) rainfall for seven months and way-below-normal  (less than 40 per cent of average) rainfall for three months, according to the  Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration  (PAGASA)</p>

              </div>
              <h3>Landless farmers without  coping mechanisms suffer production loss</h3>
              <p>For  Jennie Korbo, a small-scale farmer in Alabel municipality of Sarangani, waiting  for the rain was not an option. She grows corn on her rented 1.8-hectare land,  which yields 3.7 tons or 148 sacks of corn during a normal farming season. Due  to frequent water shortage this season, her corn has been withered and she is  expecting to harvest less than 1 ton or about 40 sacks. </p>
<p>Though she had heard about  El Niño and its effects on the radio, she took the risk of planting in August  2015 because she could not afford to delay harvest. In addition to PhP7,000  (US$147) annual rent for the farmland, Jennie had borrowed P30,000 ($628) to  buy seeds, fertilizer and chemical spray for the corn. With most of her corn  damaged, she lost over P10,000 ($209) net profit this season and can pay back  only P8,000 ($167) out of her loans. A working mother of five, Jennie is  worried her family might remain in debt for several farming seasons to come. </p>
              <p>Many landless farmers in Mindanao share similar stories. While they  cultivate one of the richest farmlands in the country, they are often chronically food insecure. A single bad harvest can strain their already-poor  access to food as well as their income to purchase alternatives. Coupled with  low literacy levels and a dependence on rural livelihoods, they find it  extremely difficult to cope with the impact of El Niño.</p>
              <h3>The  Government steps up mitigation measures</h3>
                <p>The Department of  Agriculture (DA) through its regional office has taken various measures to  mitigate the impact of El Niño to support farmers like Jennie. These include distribution  to affected farmers of water pumps and replacement seeds of drought-tolerant  and early-maturing crop varieties, and the construction and rehabilitation of  small impounding projects, diversion dams, and irrigation canals. Pest  surveillance and cloud seeding have also taken place. In addition the DA  engaged in information and education campaigns to raise awareness on how to  cope with El Niño through conducting training on soil and water conservation  and climate change adaptation by a shift in cropping calendars.</p>
<p>The provincial and  municipal authorities of Sarangani and Alabel are also assisting affected  farmers through the loan of tractors to rehabilitate farmlands, purchasing  additional rice and corn seeds for distribution, and providing strategic  guidance to increase production in areas not as badly affected by El Niño.</p>
                <h3>85 per cent of the country projected  to experience drought by April</h3>
                <p>The  PAGASA predicts that El Niño will remain strong until February and most  provinces in central and western Mindanao will continue to experience below-average  rainfall from January to April. By the end of April, 85 per cent of the country  including the whole of Region XII will face drought. The DA is carrying out an  impact assessment on food security with production data to be compiled by  March.  </p>
<p>Persisting dry conditions  and the resulting water shortage may also have health implications. The local  health station in Jennie&rsquo;s neighbourhood reported increased incidence of  diarrhoea, cold-like symptoms and hypertension over the recent months. Skin disease  is also on the rise. Health workers fear that El Niño may worsen the situation  and increase malnutrition among children.</p>
              <p>Jennie&rsquo;s  hand pump is drawing less and less water to her farm now. She plans to install  additional pipes to reach the receding water table to save her surviving corn.</p>

              <h2>Triple weather disturbances  hit the Philippines</h2>
              <h3>Over 700,000 people  pre-emptively evacuate ahead of typhoon landfall</h3>
                <p>Amid the response to Typhoon Koppu (known locally as  Lando), which battered central and northern Luzon in October, three more  weather disturbances affected the Philippines in December.</p>
<p>From 14 to 16 December, Typhoon Melor carved through  central Philippines bringing destructive winds of 150 km/h and gusts of up to 185  km/h, and heavy rainfall. 743,000 people along the typhoon&rsquo;s projected path pre-emptively  evacuated to safer ground. Typhoon Melor made five landfalls in the provinces  of Northern Samar, Sorsogon, Masbate, Romblon and Oriental Mindoro, leaving a  trail of destruction which resulted in 42 deaths, over 270,000 damaged houses  and P6.45 billion ($135 million) in damage to agriculture and infrastructure.</p>
              <p>Authorities were still assessing the impact of Typhoon Melor when Tropical  Depression Onyok made landfall over Davao Oriental province in Mindanao on 18  December. It dumped heavy rains over Mindanao, providing relief to parched  lands suffering the effects of El Niño. The tropical depression also enhanced  the northeast monsoon, bringing heavy rain over the eastern parts of Luzon,  Metro Manila and the Bicol Region and further hampered the recovery in areas affected  by Typhoons Koppu and Melor. </p>

                <h3>State of national calamity  declared to facilitate localised response</h3>
                <p>The President of the Philippines on 18 December declared  a state of national calamity to allow local authorities to access funds from  the national budget to hasten rescue, relief, recovery, and rehabilitation  efforts. </p>
                <p>The Government&rsquo;s  response to the successive weather events was indicative of its efforts to  devolve operational leadership for preparedness and response from the national to  regional and local authorities. This was supported by the Government&rsquo;s early  warning system that provided timely and improved hazard information to  facilitate local action.</p>

<h3>Humanitarian Country Team  provides targeted assistance</h3>
                <p>Members of the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) and its partners provided targeted emergency  shelter, food and non-food items, logistics, water, sanitation and hygiene,  health, early recovery, livelihood, and community engagement support as requested by government  departments and affected local authorities, and as assessments revealed the  need. This  was done in a manner similar to the response to Typhoon Koppu – with assistance  mobilised primarily with resources available in the country – following the  Government&rsquo;s preference.</p>
                  <p>To build  on the lessons of the response to recent weather disturbances, the HCT proposed  an after action review with the Government in early 2016. In particular, many  humanitarian agencies in the Philippines relied on relief items stocked from  previous emergency operations to respond to the Government&rsquo;s request for  assistance with in-country resources. These supplies however are finite and  need to be replenished ahead of another disaster.</p>
                <p>In parallel  to the discussion on international resources mobilisation, the HCT will  continue to support the Government to develop a framework for joint rapid needs  assessments. This will be aided by appropriate technologies and procedures for  effective information gathering, sharing and analysis.</p>

              <h2>Way forward for  Zamboanga IDPs</h2>
              <h3><strong>Visit of the Humanitarian Coordinator and the Way Forward workshop</strong></h3>
              <p>As of 4 January, some 16,900 internally displaced  people (IDPs) remain in 12 transition sites across Zamboanga City. They have  been waiting for a new home where they can rebuild their lives since the September  2013 fighting between government forces and factions of the Moro National  Liberation Front. With little progress in the construction of permanent  housing, most of these IDPs are expected to remain in the transition sites well  past March. In addition, an estimated 7,700 &ldquo;home-based&rdquo; IDPs are continually  hosted by relatives and friends or renting temporary homes. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>Mr. Ola Almgren, the UN Resident and Humanitarian  Coordinator in the Philippines, visited Zamboanga City from 10 to 11 December. In  transition sites and permanent housing site, Mr. Almgren spoke with camp  managers and displaced families who raised concerns over the lack of water and  livelihoods. He also met with the city mayor and the Zamboanga Mindanao  Humanitarian Team (ZMHT) to discuss remaining humanitarian and recovery needs. </p>
<p>On 17 December, ZMHT members invited sectoral  representatives of the city authorities to discuss key residual concerns for  the IDPs and ways forward in recovery. CFSI, CRS, FAO, ILO, IOM and UNHCR  confirmed to maintain its field presence in Zamboanga into 2016. These agencies  will continue to support the city authorities with temporary and permanent  shelter, sustainable livelihoods, camp management and protection assistance.</p>

<h3>Zamboanga City authorities  declare a state of calamity due to El Niño</h3>
              <p>Zamboanga  City re-introduced periodic water rationing on 8 January as the water level of the  local dam reached a critical level due to the persistent dry spell. On 12  January, the city authorities declared a state of calamity to allow  implementation of contingency plans using the Government&rsquo;s calamity fund. Tension  between the displaced families and their host communities is escalating due to  insufficient water supply. The impending drought may exacerbate the  relationship between the communities.</p>

              <h3>Zamboanga community  engagement learning review report released</h3>
              <p>The report of the Zamboanga  Learning Review on Post-Conflict Community Engagement was released on 14  January. The report captures good practices and lessons of the Zamboanga  Communications Working Group&rsquo;s community engagement efforts. The group was  established in October 2013 under the leadership of the City&rsquo;s Public  Information Office and comprises international and local aid agencies. It  facilitates humanitarian communications and accountability of aid to the  displaced families. The report underscores the importance of mainstreaming  two-way communication, community participation and common service partnerships  in all emergency response programming including in post-conflict settings.</p>
