              <h2>Small-scale farmers bear the brunt of El Niño in southern Mindanao</h2>
              <h3>Breadbasket of Mindanao hit by prolonged dry spell</h3>
                <p>While  the rains from Typhoon Melor (known locally as Nona), Tropical Depression Onyok  and the enhanced northeast monsoon brought much-needed respite from the drying  effects of El Niño, large areas of the Philippines are expected to suffer  droughts in the coming months. Small-scale farmers of southern Mindanao are  already suffering a big drop in their crop production, and fear that El Niño  might push them into a cycle of debt over three to four farming seasons. </p>
              <div>
                  <div> </div>
                </div>
<p>Region  XII of the Philippines, composed of South Cotabato, North Cotabato, Sultan  Kudarat and Sarangani provinces, is considered the breadbasket of Mindanao. The  region supplies over 40 per cent of the national food requirements and  contributes more than 30 per cent of food export according to FAO. Farmers here  produce staple crops including rice and corn and cultivate large plantations of  cash crops such as bananas and pineapples. </p>
The prevailing El Niño has  dried up the region in the past year. Sarangani province in particular recorded  below-normal (40-80 per  cent of average) rainfall for seven months and way-below-normal (less than 40  per cent of average) rainfall for three months in 2015. As a result,  farmers in Sarangani received only 54 per cent of annual rainfall last year, according to the Philippine  Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).

              </div>
              <h3>Landless farmers without  coping mechanisms suffer production loss</h3>
              <p>For  Jennie Korbo, a small-scale farmer in Alabel municipality of Sarangai, waiting  for the rain was not an option. She grows corn on her rented 1.8-hectare land,  which yields 3.7 tons or 148 sacks of corn during a normal farming season. Due  to frequent water shortage this season, her corn has been withered and she is  expecting to harvest less than 1 ton or about 40 sacks. </p>
Though she had heard about  El Niño and its effects on the radio, she took the risk of planting in August  2015 because she could not afford to delay harvest. In addition to PhP7,000  (US$147) annual rent for the farmland, Jennie had borrowed P30,000 ($628) to  buy seeds, fertilizer and chemical spray for the corn. With most of her corn  damaged, she lost over P10,000 ($209) net profit this season and can pay back  only P8,000 ($167) out of her loans. A working mother of five, Jennie is  worried her family might remain in debt for several farming seasons to come.
                <p>Many  landless farmers in Mindanao share similar stories. While they cultivate one of  the richest farmlands in the country, they are often chronically food insecure. Bad harvest can strain their access to food;  they can neither consume their own production nor make sufficient income to  purchase food. Coupled with low literacy level and dependence  on rural livelihoods, they find it extremely difficult to cope with the impact  of El Niño. </p>
              <h3>The  Government steps up mitigation measures</h3>
                <p>
                  The Department of  Agriculture (DA) through its regional office has carried out various measures to  mitigate the impact of El Niño to support the farmers like Jennie. These  include distribution of open source pumps; construction and rehabilitation of  small impounding projects, diversion dams, and irrigation canals; pest  surveillance; cloud seeding; and distribution of replacement seeds and  drought-tolerant and early-maturing crop varieties to affected farmers. The DA  also engaged in information and education campaigns to raise awareness on how  to cope with El Niño through conducting training on soil and water conservation  and climate change adaptation to shift cropping calendars.<br>
                The provincial and  municipal authorities of Sarangani and Alabel are also assisting affected  farmers through lending tractors to rehabilitate farmlands, increasing the  production in areas not affected by El Niño to fill the gaps left by crop damage  and purchasing additional rice and corn seeds. </p>
                <h3>About 85 per cent of the  country to experience drought by April</h3>
                <p>The  PAGASA predicts that El Niño will remain strong until February and most  provinces in central and western Mindanao will continue to experience below-average  rainfall from January to April. By the end of April, 85 per cent of the country  including the whole of Region XII will face drought. The DA is carrying out an  impact assessment on food security with production data to be compiled by  March.  </p>
              <p>Persisting dry conditions  and resulting water shortage may also have health implications. Local health  station in Jennie&rsquo;s neighbourhood reported increased incidence of diarrhoea,  cold-like symptoms and hypertension over the recent months. Skin disease is  also on the rise. The health workers fear that El Niño may worsen the situation  and increase malnutrition among children.
</p>
              <p>Jennie&rsquo;s  hand pump is drawing less and less water to her farm now. She plans to install  additional pipes to reach the receding water table to save her surviving corn.</p><div class="img-holder">

              <h2>Triple weather disturbances  hit the Philippines</h2>
              <h3>Over 700,000 people  pre-emptively evacuate ahead of typhoon landfall</h3>
                <p>Amid the response to Typhoon Koppu (known locally as  Lando), which battered central and northern Luzon in October, three more  weather disturbances affected the Philippines in December.</p>
                <p>From 14 to 16 December, Typhoon Melor carved through  central Philippines carrying destructive winds of 150 km/h and gusts of up to  185 km/h, and heavy rainfall. About 743,000 people along the typhoon&rsquo;s  projected path pre-emptively evacuated to safer grounds. Typhoon Melor made  five landfalls in the provinces of Northern Samar, Sorsogon, Masbate, Romblon  and Oriental Mindoro, leaving a trail of destruction which resulted in 42  deaths, over 270,000 damaged houses and PhP6.45 billion ($135 million) damages  in agriculture and infrastructure.</p>
                <p>Authorities were still assessing the impact of Typhoon Melor when a  tropical depression known locally as Onyok made landfall over Davao Oriental province  in Mindanao on 18 December. Tropical Depression Onyok dumped heavy rains over  Mindanao Island, providing relief to parched lands that suffered from the  effects of El Niño. The tropical depression also enhanced the Northeast  Monsoon, which brought rains over the eastern parts of Luzon, Metro Manila and  the Bicol Region and further hampered the recovery in areas affected by  Typhoons Koppu and Melor. </p>
                <h3>State of national calamity  declared to facilitate localised response</h3>
                <p>The President of the Philippines on 18 December declared  a state of national calamity to allow local authorities to access funds from  the national budget to hasten the rescue, relief, recovery, and rehabilitation  efforts following the three  hydro-meteorological hazards. </p>
              <p>The Government&rsquo;s response to the successive weather  events was indicative of its efforts to devolve operational leadership for  preparedness and response from the national to regional and local authorities. This  was supported by the Government&rsquo;s early warning system that provided timely and  improved hazard information that facilitated local actions.

<h3>Humanitarian Country Team  provides targeted assistance</h3>
                <p>The members of the  Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) and its partners <a target="_blank" href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/phl-ocha-ty_melor_3w_map_07jan2015.pdf">provided</a> emergency shelter, food and non-food items,  logistics, water, sanitation and hygiene, health, early recovery, livelihood, and community engagement support as requested by government  departments and affected local authorities, and as assessments revealed the  need. This was done in a manner  similar to the response to Typhoon Koppu – with assistance mobilised primarily  with resources available  in the country – following the Government&rsquo;s preference.</p>
                <p>To elucidate  lessons of the response to these recent weather disturbances, the HCT proposed  an after action review with the Government in early 2016. In particular, many  humanitarian agencies in the Philippines relied on relief items stocked from previous  emergency operations to response to the Government&rsquo;s request for assistance with in-country  resources. These supplies however are finite and need to be urgently replenished ahead of  another disaster.<br>
                In parallel to the discussion on international  resource mobilisation,  the HCT will continue to support the Government to enhance coordination of joint  rapid needs assessment, aided by appropriate technologies and procedures for  effective information gathering, sharing and analysis.</p>

              <h2>Way forward for  Zamboanga IDPs</h2>
              <h3><strong>Over 24,600 people remain  displaced without durable solutions</strong></h3>
              <p>2015 was  another long year for over 24,600 internally displaced people (IDPs) who lost  their homes to the September 2013 conflict in Zamboanga City. The  Government&rsquo;s roadmap to provide sustainable housing solutions for the displaced  families has been delayed considerably beyond its original implementation target  of June 2015. <br>
Meanwhile,  humanitarian agencies have stretched their resources to fill the gaps in basic  services for the IDPs who have been without sustainable livelihoods for over  two years. They also advocated crucial protection needs of the IDPs, many of  whom are of minority Muslim groups with indigenous origin, to be adequately  informed of the Government&rsquo;s housing plan and to negotiate assistance for their  socially- and culturally-specific needs. </p>
As of 4 January, some 16,900 IDPs are staying in 12  transitional sites across the city, waiting for a new home where they can  rebuild their lives. With little progress in the construction of permanent  housing, most of these IDPs are expected to remain in the transitional sites  well past March. In addition, an estimated 7,700 &ldquo;home-based&rdquo; IDPs are  continually hosted by relatives and friends or renting temporary homes.
<div>
  <div id="ftn1">
    <p> In  September 2013, violent fighting erupted in Zamboanga City between the  Government forces and a faction of the Moro National Liberation Front. The  three-week conflict left over 10,000 houses destroyed and about 118,000 people  displaced. </p>

  </div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Visit of the Humanitarian  Coordinator and Way Forward workshop</strong></h3>
              <p>Mr. Ola  Almgren, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the Philippines,  visited Zamboanga City from 10 to 11 December. Mr. Almgren visited transitional  sites in Mampang and Kasanyangan, where he spoke with camp managers and  displaced families who shared their concerns over the lack of water and  livelihoods. He also visited the permanent housing site in Mariki and met with  the city mayor to discuss recovery needs in Zamboanga. At the monthly meeting  of the Zamboanga Mindanao Humanitarian Team (ZMHT), Mr. Almgren acknowledged the challenges surrounding slow transition  to early recovery and stressed the HCT&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining its focus on  Mindanao including Zamboanga in 2016.</p>
On 17 December, ZMHT  members invited sectoral representatives of the city authorities to discuss key  residual concerns for the IDPs in Zamboanga and ways forward in recovery. CFSI,  CRS, FAO, ILO, IOM and UNHCR confirmed to maintain its field presence in  Zambaonga into 2016. These agencies will continually support the city  authorities with provision of temporary and permanent shelter, sustainable  livelihood, camp management and protection assistance to the remaining IDPs.

              <h3>Water shortage feared to escalate the tension between  IDPs and their host communities</h3>
              <p>Zamboanga City re-introduced periodic water  rationing on 8 January as the water level of a local dam reached a critical  level due to persisting dry spell. On 12 January, the city authorities declared  a state of calamity to allow implementation of contingency plans using the Government&rsquo;s  calamity fund. While the IDPs at the transitional sites were planned to be  priorities for water delivery, insufficient water supply is reportedly  escalating the tension between the displaced families and their host  communities. An expected drought in the coming months may put further pressure  to the IDPs. </p>

              <h3>Zamboanga community  engagement learning review report released</h3>
              <p>The report of Zamboanga Learning Review on  Post-Conflict Community Engagement was released on 14 January. The report  captures good practices and lessons of the community engagement efforts  spearheaded by the Zamboanga Communications Working Group. The group was  established in October 2013 under the leadership of the City&rsquo;s Public Information  Office and was joined by international and local aid agencies to facilitate  humanitarian communications and accountability of aid for the displaced  families. The report underscores the importance of mainstreaming two-way  communication, community participation and common service partnerships in all  emergency response programming including in post-conflict settings.</p>
