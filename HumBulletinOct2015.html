              <h2>Rapidly responding to Typhoon Koppu</h2>
              <h3>Typhoon displaces more than 1 million people</h3>
                <p>Category-3 <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/phl-ocha-ty_koppu_humanitarian_snapshot_04nov2015.pdf">Typhoon  Koppu</a> (known locally as Lando) made landfall over Casiguran municipality in  Aurora province in Region III on 18 October. While not striking with the same strength  as super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in November 2013, Typhoon Koppu was unusually  large and slow-moving and brought intense rain within its 650 km diameter for  more than four days. It caused flooding, flash floods and landslides, leaving  48 people dead, 83 injured and 4 still missing, according to the National  Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC). The typhoon steadily  weakened to a low pressure area as it exited the Philippine Area of  Responsibility a week after landfall, affecting all seven regions of the Luzon  island. </p>
<p>The number of evacuees reached a peak of 1 million  people on 29 October, 11&nbsp;days after typhoon&rsquo;s landfall. Northern Luzon is  a mountainous region and it took several days for the rainwater to flow  downstream and exacerbate flooding in the low-lying river basins where  floodwater is known to recede slowly. Flooding persists in the provinces of  Pangasinan (Region I), Pampanga and Bulacan (Region III) in the Cagayan and  Pampanga river basins as of 3 November while subsiding elsewhere. It could take  until mid-November for the floodwaters to completely recede. Prolonged  displacement due to persistent flooding raises the risk of water-borne and  communicable disease outbreaks. </p>
Some 713,600 people remain displaced as of 3 November. The vast majority  are with relatives and friends or in the open nearby their damaged homes in  Regions I, II and III where damage to houses was the most significant. People  with damaged houses may remain displaced until their homes are repaired or  reconstructed, requiring extended humanitarian aid such as enhanced disease  surveillance, shelter repair kits, protection particularly against trafficking,  and livelihoods support.

              <h3>Flooding devastates small-scale farmers already  suffering from El Niño</h3>
              <p>Typhoon Koppu flooded vast tracts of agricultural land  in Region III. Estimated cost of damage to agriculture reached US$180 million,  primarily in crop loss, according to the Department of Agriculture. Rice, which  is the staple crop in the Philippines, constitutes 88 per cent of the crop  production loss. </p>
Recovery of small-scale farmers will be slow as many do not have access  to credit and their current cropping season (May to October) was already  affected by the intensifying El&nbsp;Niño since early 2015, according to the  government-led multi-sectoral rapid damage and needs assessment (RDANA) undertaken  from 22 to 27 October. With now two consecutive cropping seasons ruined, the  next harvest is expected a year from now, raising concerns for deterioration in  food insecurity and malnutrition. A rapid provision of agricultural inputs will  help restore and protect the availability of food as well as to rebuild the  livelihoods of those hard-hit by the typhoon.
              <h3>Partners respond with in-country resources upon  Government&rsquo;s request</h3>
                <p>Government-led early warning, pre-emptive evacuations  and various preparedness measures that were supported by communities, civil  society organizations, the Philippine Red Cross, the private sector and other  partners saved lives. The Response Pillar of the NDRRMC, one of the four  disaster risk reduction and management pillars, established Task Force  Casiguran to set up a humanitarian coordination hub in Casiguran on 23&nbsp;October  to support local authorities manage the humanitarian response for Aurora, where  Typhoon Koppu made landfall. The task force was quickly stood down on 28  October when the situation stabilized. <br>
The Philippines Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) is  providing targeted support in logistics, camp coordination and camp management,  emergency shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), food, protection,  coordination and information management upon the Government&rsquo;s request,  mobilizing resources available in the country. The HCT also supported RDANA and  the humanitarian coordination hub in Casiguran. </p>
The HCT&rsquo;s Community of Practice (CoP) on <a href="http://www.unocha.org/philippines/about-ocha-philippines/community-engagement">Community  Engagement</a> also complemented the government response through communications  support including the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor typhoon&rsquo;s  physical impact and a series of community consultations. The partnerships  within the CoP quickly facilitated these activities, bringing fresh  perspectives to the relief operation and ensuring that the voices of affected  communities reached humanitarian responders at the national and local levels.

              <h2>Peace and security for Surigao del Sur <em>lumads</em></h2>
              <h3><strong>Over 3,000 indigenous people are unsure when they can return home</strong></h3>
                <p>In the province of Surigao del Sur in northeastern Mindanao, the main  sports complex of the provincial capital Tandag City has been occupied by  thousands of indigenous people from remote, mountainous communities for over  two months. They fled their homes after a community-run school in Lianga  municipality in the southern end of the province was attacked by a paramilitary  group on 1 September. The incident triggered panic and widespread fear among  indigenous <em>lumads</em> in Lianga and four  neighbouring municipalities, prompting them to leave their homes and farms for  safety.</p>
<p>About 3,300 people  remain displaced as of 20 October, according to the Provincial Disaster Risk  Reduction and Management Office. The vast majority – about 2,800 people – are  staying in the sports complex, while the rest are in the municipalities of San  Agustin and Marihatag.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We were displaced  before, but this time is different,&rdquo; says Tata, 23-year-old mother of two  children. Tata and her <em>lumad</em> neighbours fled their homes in <em>Barangay</em> (the smallest administrative unit in the Philippines) Diatagon in Lianga,  immediately after the attack in their community, and arrived in Tandag City the  following day. While safer, life at the sports complex was difficult for her  family. &ldquo;We have to bear the heat inside our tent and, when it rains, it can  get flooded, but we will endure.&rdquo; </p>

  <div> </div>
</div>
                <h3><strong>Local authorities and humanitarian partners continue to provide aid</strong></h3>
                <p>The provincial authorities with support from international and local  partners are coordinating <a href="https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/system/files/documents/files/phl-ocha-mindanao_surigao_tandag_city_evacuation_centre-20_oct_2015.pdf">relief  assistance</a> for the displaced families in the sports complex. Agencies took  turns to ensure that all internally displaced people (IDPs) received adequate  food assistance since the onset of the crisis.    <br>
Tata, however, says they still &ldquo;lack water and sanitation facilities as  there are too many of us.&rdquo; Daily water supply to the site has dwindled and there  are only 10 functional toilets.</p>
<p>To mitigate the situation, health authorities installed 15 waterless  portalets and the Philippine Red Cross is constructing 36 additional toilets. Other  humanitarian partners provided a communal water bladder and distributed hygiene  kits for over 500 displaced families. A hygiene promotion campaign and  construction of bathing and other WASH facilities are underway. The authorities  also set up a mobile health clinic and local faith groups are conducting  medical consultations.  </p>
<p>For children whose education was disrupted by displacement,  community-run alternative learning programmes resumed two weeks after they fled  to the sports complex. Some 100 high school students and 800 elementary school  pupils are continuing their classes in temporary learning spaces provided by  humanitarian partners. Aid agencies also provided 1,000 elementary school  packs, 200 pupil school bags, 50 teacher bags, recreation kits and a library  set.  </p>
Many are eager to return to  their homes but are concerned about the security situation in their villages  and thus enduring a protracted stay in the evacuation sites with limited livelihood  options. Tata and her fellow <em>lumad</em> people are waiting for lasting peace and adequate protection support in order to  resume their normal life in the highlands.</div><!-- /.col-sm-8 -->

              <h2>Zamboanga IDPs eager to restore livelihoods</h2>
              <h3><strong>About 28,500 displaced people struggle to make their  ends meet</strong></h3>
              <p>She accepts laundry  jobs, tends her small vegetable garden in a box and peddles her little produce  at a nearby market, yet the income is not enough to feed her family.</p>
<p>Bibing Albani, a  40-year-old mother of six children, lives in Mampang-2, one of the biggest  transitional sites in Zamboanga City. Her neighbours are about 4,600 fellow IDPs  who were uprooted by the September 2013 conflict between the government forces  and a faction of the Moro National Liberation Front. The crisis at its peak  displaced some 118,000 people, of whom about 28,500 remain without permanent  homes today. Almost 17,200 people stay in 12 transitional sites across the  city, while an estimated 11,300 are &ldquo;home-based&rdquo; IDPs who are hosted by friends  and relatives or renting temporary homes.</p>
<p>Bibing never fails  to attend livelihood training offered in Mampang. &ldquo;I put my heart in all the  learning. I used to plant seaweed in the sea. Now I plant tomatoes. I need to  learn to survive but it&rsquo;s not enough.&rdquo;</p>
Mampang sites are over 10 km  away from the city centre. The distance makes life in Mampang expensive.  Bibing&rsquo;s daily earnings of PhP100 ($2.2) cannot cover the transportation cost  and support her children.</p>
<p>Bibing wishes to  return to <em>Barangay </em>Mariki, her home  before the conflict, where &ldquo;PhP20 ($0.44) [a day] was enough to survive.&rdquo;  Mariki is within the central district of Zamboanga, where everything is a  walking distance. It is also close to the sea where indigenous <em>Badjiao </em>people like Bibing could catch  fish and farm seaweed for livelihood.</p>

</div>
<h3><strong>More than a roof</strong></h3>
              <p>Some displaced  mothers have capitalized on relief assistance given to them to rebuild their  lives. Rashidam Hussin, a 47-year-old mother of five children, is busy filling  her small retail store with food items, medicines, school supplies, clothing,  cosmetics and &ldquo;anything that is needed here.&rdquo; </p>
              <p>When her family was  allowed to return to their home ground in Mariki in September 2015,after two  years of displacement, Rashidam  prioritized putting up her store over housing because &ldquo;I can always build a  house from what I earn from my store.&rdquo; <br>
              Rashidam used a  humanitarian cash grant, which she received&nbsp;while staying in the city&rsquo;s  sports complex then used as an evacuation centre, as the base capital for her  store. &ldquo;What is the use of a house when one cannot afford food? Here, we may  not have a good roof but we earn. We can eat three times a day. This is what we  call a real life,&rdquo; she says. </p>

              </div></p>
              <h3><strong>Livelihood assistance by the government and aid  agencies</strong></h3></p>
              <p>According to Zamboanga  City authorities, PhP20 million ($489,000) was allocated as bottom-up budgeting  funds to support the livelihood of the displaced.&nbsp;The government also  provides free skills development training with scholarships for vulnerable  groups including IDPs.</p>
<p>                For people like  Bibing and Nurmini Hassan, another 28-year-old displaced mother of three  children staying in Mampang, these funds fall short of restoring their  livelihoods. Nurmini says there is training but not enough capital. &ldquo;Any cash  assistance we receive is barely enough to buy food for survival and my husband  resorted to a loan shark.&rdquo; </p>
<p>                In support of the government efforts, FAO  and ILO are implementing a joint programme to provide sustainable livelihood  opportunities targeting about 400 beneficiaries and their families, in  particular the youth, women and indigenous peoples. FAO is distributing fishing  gear, fish-processing and seaweed farming kits and vegetable seed packages while  ILO is focusing on skills training and community-based enterprise development. The  programme aims to provide good examples of livelihood assistance that restore  dignity of the long-suffering IDPs and help them rebuild their lives.</p>
