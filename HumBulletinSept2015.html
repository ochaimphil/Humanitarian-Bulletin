              <h2>Highland farmers in Maguindanao endure conflict,  food insecurity and El Niño</h2>
              <h3><strong>Strong El Niño in progress and to persist into the second quarter of  2016</strong></h3>
                <p>The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and  Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) on 30 September <a href="https://web.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/index.php/news/92-press-release/1699-strong-el-nino-is-present-and-further-strengthens">announced</a> that a mature and &ldquo;strong&rdquo; El Niño now prevails in the tropical Pacific Ocean,  upgrading the categorization from &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; conditions observed in the four  months since June. PAGASA projects that the current El Niño event may intensify  to a strength comparable to or even surpassing that of the 1997-1998 El&nbsp;Niño,  which was among the strongest on record to date, and is likely to persist until  the second quarter of 2016. Forecast models suggest that large parts of the  country would be affected by below-normal rainfall and above-normal temperature  until May or June 2016, before the weather system transitions into the rainy  season. </p>
<p>                Dry spell and drought conditions are feared  to impact the country&rsquo;s agricultural and energy sectors as well as food  security. Prolonged drought can drastically cut down the  production of local crops such as rice and corn, as well as fisheries yield.  The 1997-1998 El Niño affected 74,000 hectares of agricultural land  in 18 provinces of the Philippines. The strongest impact was felt in Mindanao,  where almost half a million agricultural families faced severe food insecurity.  The current El Niño episode has already affected over 32,000 hectares of rice  fields which are left idle due to dry conditions in the first three quarters of  the year.</p>

                <div class="caption">Credit: OCHA/M. Malang.  Ernesto points to his hilltop corn farm in Sitio Ba-ay, Datu Saudi Ampatuan,  Maguindanao (September 2015).</div>
              </div>
              <h3><strong>Highland farmers in Maguindanao particularly vulnerable</strong></h3>
              <p>Ernesto Sangcopan, an indigenous <em>T&rsquo;duray </em>farmer in central Mindanao, is  worried that the intensifying El Niño might bring more dry weather in the  coming months, cutting agricultural yield in the already resource-exhausted  community. Ernesto lives in Sitio Ba-ay, a hilltop village of about 110 <em>T&rsquo;duray</em> families in the municipality of  Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Maguindanao province. The community settled there some 15  years ago after fleeing conflict in its ancestral land on Firis Hill located 13  km away. As Sitio Ba-ay is located near a military check point, frequent  harassment by opposing armed forces continues to this day. </p>
<p>The main source of livelihood in Sitio Ba-ay is corn,  mung beans, peanuts and root crops farming. With good weather, Ernesto&rsquo;s farm  can be harvested twice a year, yielding 15 to 18 sacks of corn or  PhP10,000-15,000 (US$210-320) per harvest. Between November 2014 and April 2015,  the community missed a whole planting season due to the lack of rain. Ernesto  resorted to selling firewood and charcoal but the sales hardly cover the  expenses of horses and rented motorcycles to carry the produce and woods over  rough terrain to reach the main road.</p>
              <p>Maguindanao is likely  to experience a dry spell from October to November and drought from December to  January 2016, according to PAGASA. Small-scale farmers in highland communities  like Sitio Ba-ay are considered particularly vulnerable to the drying effects  of El Niño due to limited water resource and coping mechanisms. Lowland  communities on the other hand have alternative livelihood options such as  converting dried but fertile marshland to grow cash crops that are resistant to  drought.</p>
              <p>Maguindanao, along with 15  other provinces in Mindanao, was found moderately food insecure by the <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/FAO%20Philippines%20Newsletter%20Issue%203.pdf">Integrated  Food Security Phase Classification chronic analysis</a> conducted by FAO and  partners in January. WFP in the preliminary results of its combined food  security assessment cited that the province was 29 per cent moderately food  insecure and 2 per cent severely food insecure. </p>
<h3><strong>Local and national authorities step up mitigation measures</strong></h3>
                <p>To mitigate the adverse  effects of El Niño, local authorities are pre-positioning relief items for  indigenous communities in eight municipalities of Maguindanao province including  Datu Saudi Ampatuan. National government-implemented measures include: provision  of improved water systems and drought-tolerant crop varieties for farmers,  cloud-seeding operations to induce rain in major watersheds and drought-affected  communities, water rationing and public campaigns on water conservation.  International organizations are monitoring the situation closely to augment the  government response as necessary. </p>
Despite persisting  insecurity and other hardships, Ernesto is determined to stay in Sitio Ba-ay,  because &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nowhere else for us to go&rdquo;. Timely and well-targeted  assistance to mitigate further effects of conflict and El Niño is essential to  support the already-vulnerable communities like Sitio Ba-ay to cope with  difficulties and allow for indigenous people like Ernesto to maintain a little  peace in what they now call home.    <div class="img-holder">

              <h2>Two years later: Zamboanga IDP  portraits</h2><p>It is still a long way to  normalcy, as far as the 5,700 displaced families are concerned. Over 24,000  families or about 118,000 people were displaced as a result of the Zamboanga  siege in September 2013, when the government forces and a faction of the Moro  National Liberation Front clashed in the city centre. Two years later, some  28,500 internally displaced people (IDPs) are left with no permanent homes. Two  thirds – some 17,200 people – are staying in 12 transitional sites across the  city, while an estimated 11,300 others are &ldquo;home-based&rdquo; IDPs who are either  hosted by relatives and friends or availing of the government&rsquo;s house rental  assistance.</p>
              <p><h3>&ldquo;Our identification card is gold&rdquo;</h3></p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our identification  card is very precious to us. It is like gold - if we lose this, we lose  everything,&rdquo; says Jomar Sapii, a fisherman from Sumariki Island. Jomar is one  of over 400 villagers of Sumariki displaced by the September 2013 siege. He is  now staying with relatives at the mainland <em>barangay</em> (the smallest administrative unit in the Philippines) of Talon-talon.</p>
              <p>Shaina Gani, a displaced mother  of four, explains that the cards serve as an entry pass for her husband and his  fellow fishermen of Sumariki Island who frequent their village to fish. &ldquo;Without  the ID, our husbands cannot get through the island to fish. Fishing is the only  way we support our children,&rdquo; Shaina said.<br>
It took over a year for the  city authorities to allow displaced families of Sumariki to set foot in their place  of origin. The permit to return, however, is still conditioned and is temporary.  According to Senior Superintendent Angelito Casimiro, the Zamboanga City Police  Director and one of the three signatories to the identification cards, the  cards are &ldquo;imposed by the local government unit as part of the monitoring  system of the Zamboanga City Roadmap to Recovery and Reconstruction (Z3R).&rdquo; The  identification cards are to be surrendered when IDPs are transferred to  permanent housing. </p>
&ldquo;If we lose the ID, we don&rsquo;t  have a chance to secure permanent housing. We have already suffered so much moving  from one temporary site to another&rdquo;, says Shaina. Her family decided to leave  the transitional site and to rent a small shack closer to the island, while waiting  for a permanent home where they can resettle.

                <h3><strong>Laundry for school fare</strong></h3>
                <p>Apoh Arnado and her  two grandchildren are staying in Mampang-1 transitional site, the largest IDP  site in the city with some 4,600 people. She adopted two of her many  grandchildren, Nuraisa in the 8th grade and Farhanna in the 7th grade, &ldquo;because  they don&rsquo;t have parents anymore.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The family used to live in Rio  Hondo, one of the neighbourhoods worst affected by the September 2013 conflict,  where she put up a small retail store. &ldquo;I was strong for my age then. I could  go to the market to buy things for my store or my grandchildren could. It was  hard but we managed because of the proximity of our house to the town centre&rdquo;.</p>
<p>                  But the conflict forced  them to flee home, first to an evacuation centre in an open sports complex and  then to Mampang. Dire living conditions at the evacuation centre took a toll on  Apoh&rsquo;s health. &ldquo;You see I am very old, the heat, the congestion and the lack of  medicine made me weak.&rdquo; </p>
<p>                While the housing unit in  Mampang-1 is spacious enough for Apoh and her grandchildren, now she has to  struggle to support the family. &ldquo;I can hardly walk now, and we&rsquo;ve lost our little  savings from my store. This place is very far from the city centre where I can  buy goods to sell. So now I walk around begging neighbours to let me wash their  clothes for a fee. I need to raise money so I can send my grandchildren to  school,&rdquo; she shared.</p>

<h3><strong>City authorities struggle to provide durable solutions to displacement</strong></h3>
                <p>The national government has allocated PhP3.5  billion ($75 million) for the Z3R aimed at providing recovery and  rehabilitation assistance to the families displaced by the September 2013  conflict. In addition, the city received donations amounting to PhP22 million  ($470,000) and PhP50 million ($1.1 million) from the national Department of  Social Welfare and Development as transitory expenses. </p>
The city authorities, however, are struggling to  coordinate early recovery assistance for the displaced families and their  access to water, light, livelihood and sanitation facilities remain irregular  or insufficient in many IDP sites including Mampang, Lupa-Lupa and Mariki.  While the government has assured that the majority of the remaining IDPs would  be provided with newly constructed permanent homes by the end of 2015, most of  these permanent housing units are being built without sustainable utility  services.            </div><!-- /.col-sm-8 -->

              <h2>Violence displaces <em>Lumads</em> in Surigao del Sur</h2>
              <h3><strong>About 4,200 people flee homes following killings of community leaders</strong></h3>
              <p>Hundreds of families,  mostly from the indigenous <em>Lumad</em> communities,  fled their homes following the alleged attack by a paramilitary group against a  community-run school in Lianga municipality of Surigao del Sur province in  northeastern Mindanao on 1&nbsp;September. The school director and two community  leaders were killed in the attack. As of 4 October, over 800  families or about 4,200 people remain displaced from five municipalities of  Lianga, San Agustin, Tago, San Miguel and Marihatag, according to the Regional  Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office of Caraga. The majority of the IDPs  are staying in a sports centre in the provincial capital in Tandag City.</p>

              </div></p>
<p>The authorities at the sub-national levels provided  food packs, non-food items, water, sanitation, hygiene and medical support. With  the pre-positioned relief items running low on stock, the province on 19  September declared a state of calamity, which enabled access to the  government&rsquo;s quick response fund to continue providing assistance to the IDPs. Local  civil society and private sector partners also distributed relief items and conducted  psychosocial consultations for displaced children. UN agencies and ICRC are  coordinating with the local authorities to extend support as needed.</p>
<p>The UN Special  Rapporteurs on the rights of indigenous peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, and on  the situation of human rights defenders, Michel Forst, called on the  Philippines Government to launch a full and independent investigation into the  killings of three &ldquo;human rights defenders&rdquo; in a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16481&LangID=E#sthash.VpBlkhll.dpuf">statement</a> released on 22 September.</p>

              <h3><strong>Gender checklist for disaster risk reduction</strong></h3>
              <p>The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Gender  Checklist is a tool to ensure that all programmes and activities of public  institutions for disaster risk reduction are gender inclusive and responsive. A  core team of gender experts from the Official Development Agencies-Gender and  Development Network, consisting of foreign donor agencies, key government  agencies on gender including the Philippine Commission on Women and the  National Economic and Development Authority, UN Agencies and INGOs, drafted and  validated this tool. The checklist will be presented to the National Disaster  Risk Reduction and Management Council for adoption in October. The checklist is  envisioned as the DRR component of the Philippine Harmonized Gender Guidelines,  which consolidates gender checklists for different sectors, including <a href="http://w3.neda.gov.ph/hgdg/main/Pullout%201%20Agriculture%20and%20Agrarian%20Reform.pdf">agriculture</a> and <a href="http://www.neda.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HGGT%20Final.pdf">tourism</a>,  to help stakeholders to collectively address gender issues and challenges.</p>
